- typescript file has the EXTENSION .ts 

- to run a typescript file we in CLI type command 

    :: tsc <file_path>::

      ** when this is run.... a .JS file will be made on the same directory....
      
      ***** and WE USE THIS .JS FILE and NOT the .TS FILE 

      ***** EVERYTIME we make a change in the .ts file we NEED TO RUN THIS COMMAND to REGENERATE .ts file.... 

        ** solution is to use WATCH COMMAND (in next point)

- to track changes of a .ts file and AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE .JS file.... in cli type 

  :: tsc <file_path> -w :: 

    ** now everytime we make change in .ts file... .js file is generated AUTOMATICALLY 

    ***** BUT even if we delete a .TS FILE... its .JS FILE WON'T get deleted.... we've to MANUALLY DELETE .JS FILE
