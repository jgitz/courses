- STATIC TYPING: the datatype assigned to the variables are CHECKED AT THE COMPILE TIME

  ** hence if there is type error in the file during COMPILE TIME.. it WON'T RUN.....

  ** MOSTLY this happens with COMPILED LANGUAGE with EXCEPTIONS

- DYNAMIC TYPING: the datatype is of the variables are checked during the runtime of the program... 

  ** hence the program stops execution when it hits a line with type error 

  ** MOSTLY this happens with INTERPRETED LANGUAGE with exceptions

  
  

** ADDITIONAL FACTS: 

  - PYTHON is an INTERPRETED language with DYNAMIC TYPING 

    ** BUT STATIC TYPING can be enforced with THIRD PARTY TOOLS like "mypy" or "pyright"

  - JAVASCRIPT is a HYBRID LANGUAGE.... i.e JS is BOTH interpreted and compiled language

      ** in modern JS ENGINES in browsers.... JS CODE is first compiled to BYTECODE by JIT(Just In Time) COMPILER.... and THEN this BYTECODE is run by INTERPRETER in runtime 

  - TYPESCRIPT is a STATICALY TYPED.. COMPILED LANGUAGE 

    ** TS is COMPILED/TRANSPILED into JS CODE which is then used by BROWSER JS ENGINES

    ** TYPESCRIPT COMPILER is called TSC

  - JAVA is a STATIC TYPED.... COMPILED LANGUAGE..

    ** JAVA CODE is COMPILED to BYTECODE 

    ** BYTE CODE is the INTERPRETED by JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

    ** JVM is a PLATFORM INDEPENDENT RUN-TIME ENVIRONMENT to execute BYTECODE
