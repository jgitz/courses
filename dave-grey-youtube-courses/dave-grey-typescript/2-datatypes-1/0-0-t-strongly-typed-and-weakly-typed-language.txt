- STRONGLY TYPED LANGUAGE: we need to SPECIFY the TYPE of DATA we use 

  ** here we need to enforce the datatype of the variables EXPLICITELY

  ** ts is a strongly typed language

  ** other eg: java, C++, C#

- WEAKLY/LOOSELY TYPED LANGUAGE: we DON'T need to SPECIFY the TYPE of DATA we use 

  ** it uses IMPLICIT TYPE CONVERSION to assume the datatype of variables.... i.e the type is assumed value of the variable

  ** eg: js is a loosely typed language 

  ** other eg: pearl, php 


***** STATIC TYPED and DYNAMIC TYPED is NOT RELATED to STRONGLY TYPED and LOOSELY TYPED (next note)

  ** a strongly typed language can be EITHER STATIC or DYNAMICALY TYPED

    ** TS is a STRONGLY TYPED STATIC LANGUAGE
