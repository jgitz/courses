.... now we use VITE to set up REACT APP.... because it is faster as it use GOLANG and TYPESCRIPT 

- to create REACT APP using VITE

  - install NODE JS from nodejs site 

  - goto project folder 

    - open terminal and type 

      - :: npm create vite@latest 

      - type the project name

        ** it creates the REACT APP PROJECT FOLDER 

      - select REACT FRAMEWORK from the list 

      - select the scripting language (js/ts/remix??/js+swc??/ts+swc)

      ** NOW REACT APP PROJECT FOLDER IS CREATED 

    - goto REACT APP PROJECT FOLDER 

      - open terminal... and run command 

        :: npm i ::

      - to run the react app in browser... in the terminal... type 

        :: num run dev ::

        ** click on the LOCAL HOST link to open VITE REACT APP in the BROWSER 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- VITE REACT APP FOLDER and FILE STRUCTURE 

  - file tsconfig.json: config file of typescript

  - file package.json: config files for the project 

  - file index.html: the first file to get open when you run the app.... after this react files get executed to display the view 

    - you can set META TAGS for your react app for SEO here in the index.html 

    - has DIV TAG with id="root"

    - has a SCRIPT TAG tha points to the source file /src/main.tsx

  - file vite.config.ts: used to install PLUGINS?

  - file src/vite-env.d.ts: typescript file to add TYPES?? for ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES??

  - file src/MAIN.TSX 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- WORKING of REACT APP 

  - when the server of the app starts.... it calls index.html 

  - index.html routes the app to src/main.tsx.... because of the script tag which points to src/main.tsx inside index.html 

  - inside main.tsx..... there is REACT DOM method to RENDER the page to an HTML ELEMENT with ID of 'root'..... this HTML element is inside the INDEX.HTML 

    - inside this reander method..... all the REACT COMPONENTS are specified.... so it gets RENDERED to the 'root' element in INDEX.HTML 

    - the first COMPONENT listed is APP COMPONENT..... hence the CODES WRITTEN inside APP.TSX file gets RENDERED inside index.html
