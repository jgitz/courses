.... when a SERVER receives a CLIENT REQUEST at an SERVER ENDPOINT.... it RESOLVES THE REQUEST and SEND BACK some  META DATA as HTTP RESPONSE to the client.... these META DATAS are 

1) HTTP STATUS CODE: are THREE DIGIT NUMERAL CODES that the SERVERS give to the client.... 

  ** various codes DEFINES WHAT HAPPENED to the CLIENT REQUEST
  
  ** the DEVELOPER has to set the code to a client request manually 

  ** COMMONLY USED ERROR CODES

      - 200 OK: server successfully resolved the request and send the resource to the client

      - 400 BAD REQUEST: server cannot resolve the request DUE TO CLIENT....such as IMPROPER REQUEST SYNTAX or INVALID REQUEST PARAMETERS or empty fields

      - codes of range 300-399 are redirect messages

      - codes of range 100-199 are INFORMATIONAL RESPONSES... eg 100 requests the client to continue the request as server verifies the client request.
