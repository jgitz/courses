..... a node js server should always have 2 log files..... 

  1) to store the details when the web server is started.... in our project it should be stored in logs/startUpLogs.txt 

  2) to store the details of errors catched inside the server.... in our project it should be stored in logs/errorLogs.txt 


.... logging functionality is REALISED through a CUSTOM MODULE named logEvents.js and..

  - logEvents.js module uses date-fns and uuid packages to set log file creation logic and is exported

  - inside the server.js ... logEvents function is imported and is EMITTED and LISTENED using EVENTS CORE MODULE.... the events are EMITTED AT 3 PLACES inside server.js

    1) inside the fileServeAsync CATCH BLOCK .... emit errors

    2) inside the .createServer 404 switch block to emit 404 errors 

    3) at the start of .createServer to log the startup of server
