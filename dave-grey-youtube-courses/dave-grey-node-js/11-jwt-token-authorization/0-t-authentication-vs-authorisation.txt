..a web app user has 2 security checks to pass 

  1) AUTHENTICATION: is a process by which the IDENTITY of the USER is verified with USER CREDENTIALS such as USERNAME/EMAIL and PASSWORD..

    ** other than password... the following credentals can be used 

      - fingerprints 
      - facial recognition 
      - MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)

    ** once authentication succeeds... the user is GRANTED ACCESS to the SYSTEM/APPLICATION RESOURCES 

  2) AUTHORIZATION: is a process by which a PERMISSIONS and ACCESS levels are granted to ALREADY AUTHENTICATED USERS

    ** a system will have many resources... not all users will be allowed access to certain resources... inorder to gain access... we need to give PERMISSIONS to the users

    ** ACCESS CONTROLS can be given through

        - RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
        - ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control)
        - Custom Policies 

**Analogy 

  - AUTHENTICATION: is like PUB BOUNCER who check ID PROOF of the VISITORS 

  - AUTHORIZATION: is like additional PASSES like VIP PASS to visit VIP AREAS inside the PUB
