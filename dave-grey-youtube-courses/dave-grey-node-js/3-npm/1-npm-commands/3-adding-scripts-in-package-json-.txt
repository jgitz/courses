..... we need to use some commands to run scripts for START, RUN, DEV, TEST etc.... 

..... scripts are some commands you want to run.... 

.... npm allows you to store the LENGTHY COMMANDS and substitute with a SINGLE WORD COMMAND.... to do this we ADD the commands under SCRIPTS OBJECT in PACKAGE.JSON 


- to add a start script....

    - goto package.json file.... under the scripts object.... add the following 

      "start": "node index",

      ** this will make the node server to run index.js file on cli command 

        :: npm start 

- to add a dev script(to run index in nodemon)....

    - goto package.json file.... under the scripts object.... add the following

      "dev": "nodemon index",

      ** this will make the nodemon to run index.js on cli command 

        :: npm run dev 


        **** start command is ONE of the few command where we DON'T HAVE TO SPECIFY run....
