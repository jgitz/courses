.... using fs module method like to write, append etc can make CALLBACK HELL.... 

** the solution is to use FS PROMISES 

** FS PROMISES: is a PROPERTY from CORE FS MODULE which enables to use writeFile(), appendFile() etc using ASYNC AND AWAIT 

  ** THIS PREVENTS CALLBACK HELL

  ** error is catched by CATCH BLOCK of TRY CATCH block of async function

**** refer next lesson to implement a scenario using fs promises
