- encoding: is a process of tranferring a data from one format to other.

  ** this enables COMPATIBILITY of data to be used in different SYSTEMS and APPLICATIONS.


.... the basic form of representation of data is BINARY.... but this form is not HUMAN READABLE.....

.... so if we want to read the the data like ALPHA NUMBERICAL characters.... it is impossible to read in BINARY FOMAT FOR HUMANS...

... so we convert binary alpha numberics to a format called ASCII (olden days).... and TODAY UTF-8 encoding is used to display all language characters INCLUDING MALAYALAM....

.... even though the binary is the basic form... http PREFERS data in a STRING format to tranfer data over it because HTTP is a TEXT BASED PROTOCOL.... BUT data can be sent in BINARY FORMAT as well in http....

** commonly used encoding in web development 

  1) ascii: used to convert binary to english alphabets and number 

  2) utf-8: converts binary to almost all characters of all languages 

  3) Base64: used to convert BINARY data into ASCII format....

    ** commony used to convert images into string format 

    ** used to store images and videos in database

    ** but the resulting string has 33% increase in data size

  4) url/percentage encoding: url contains special characters which needs to be encoded.... the encoded characters are preceeded by %sign and followed by the HEXADECIMAL code of the special character.... eg / = %20 

  5) json encoding: to convert datastructures into string format 

  6) xml encoding: used to encode datastructures using markup language using tags

  7) form encoding: encodes html form data from html to formats like URL ENCODING or MULTIPART/FORM-DATA 

  ** large video files are send as CHUNKS of binary data or in is compressed formate through http
