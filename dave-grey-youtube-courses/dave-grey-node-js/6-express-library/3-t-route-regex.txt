.... one of the ADVANTAGES of EXPRESS is that it allows you to use REGEX to set ROUTE ARGUMENT inside its HTTP REQUEST METHODS.... 

- COMMONLY USED ROUTE REGEX EXAMPLES 

    1) "^/$": means the route that starts with / and ends with /

    2) "^/$|/index.html": means search for route EITHER / OR /index.html 

      ***** don't use spaces inside regex.... else error

    3) "/index(.html)?": means .html part is OPTIONAL.... route with /index or /index.html will work 

    4) "/*": means it will accept any value after / like  /ldsjf , /ljlkjk etc
