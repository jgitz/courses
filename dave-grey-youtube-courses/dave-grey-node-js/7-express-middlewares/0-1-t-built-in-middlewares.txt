.... below are the commonly used BUILT IN MIDDLEWARES and their SYNTAXES

- express.json(): used to make JSON OBJECT from JSON STRING and STORE it inside REQ.BODY

- express.urlencoded(): is used to parse the ENCODED URL which is in STRING FORMAT into JS OBJECT and STORE it inside REQ.BODY

  app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))

  ** here the extended FALSE means... the middleware PARSES ONLY STRING DATA and ARRAY DATA coming in URL ENCODED format.... if EXTENDED = TRUE means it PARSES other datastructures such as OBJECTS

- express.static(): is used to set FOLDER to serve STATIC FILES....  else our EXTERNAL CSS FILES  won't work 

  ** to set a single PUBLIC FOLDER to serve static file 

    app.use(express.static("public")) // ** allows to access index.html stored in putblic folder using browser url: localhost:5000/index.html

    app.use(express.static("assets"))    // ** this will set serve static files stored in assets folder... if there is an image in path assets/images/logo.png.... to access it through browser url.... just do localhost:5000/images/logo.png

    app.use(express.static("/home", express.static("public"))) // ** here the /home is a ROUTE WE TYPE IN BROWSER URL.... now to access an image in /public/images/logo.png.... you have to type browser url localhost:5000/home/images/logo.png








** we just use app.use() to use these middlewares like this 

  app.use(express.json())

** express.json() and express.urlencoded() are mainly used to handle POST and PUT HTTP REQUESTS 

** PARSING MEANS.... CONVERSION of data from one FORMAT to another

***** in express.... the req.body is NOT AUTOMATICALLY FILLED with CLIENT REQUEST DATA..... we'need to use MIDDLEWARE suchas urlencoded or body-parser to parse and STORE the incoming CLIENT REQUEST data inside REQ.BODY..... if NOT PARSED.... req.body is an EMPTY OBJECT

  ** in .createServer to fill the req.body... we need to use external packages like body parser
