- make a separate folder named MIDDLEWARE to store CUSTOM MIDDLEWARE 

- install packages 

    - date-fns
    - uuid

- inside the middleware folder....

    - make a custom middleware named logEvents.js... to log the following details inside a FOLDER NAMED LOG 

      - date
      - uuid 
      - req.headers.origin: to get origin domain of a cross origin request 
      - req.method: client request method get/post etc 

- now everytime you operate your web app in browser.... a log data is created and stored in log/request-logs.txt

** when you call an imported middleware inside server.js.... DON'T USE () to call the middleware function in app.use(<>)

**** but now you see undefined in the log file at the place of req.headers.origin.... now we need to rectify it by configuiring THIRD PARTY CORS middleware 

    ** without cors, you won't be able to get requests from another domains
