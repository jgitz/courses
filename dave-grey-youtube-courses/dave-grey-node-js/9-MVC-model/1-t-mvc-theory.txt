- MVC (Model View Controller) : is a SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE PATTERN which divides an application into 3 components

  1) MODEL: refers to the data/database related codes involved in the application such as DATA MODELING CODES

  2) VIEW: refers to the USER INTERFACE of the application 

  3) CONTROLLER: refers to the BUSINESS LOGIC to implement MODEL-VIEW communication 


  ** ANALOGY: if you consider a restaurant 

      - VIEW is the TABLE you are sitting 

      - MODEL is the KITCHEN from which the customer obtains the meal 

      - CONTROLLER is the WAITER who takes order and deliver meals to the controller
