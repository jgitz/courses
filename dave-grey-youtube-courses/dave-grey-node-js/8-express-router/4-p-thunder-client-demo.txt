- set up a route named /employees to practice thunder client requests 

- use codes to practice working of get, post, put and delete requests from thunder client 

- also test req.params.<param_name>

** we don't really use database to practice CRUD OPERATION.... we just send a response from the server back to thunder client to show that the crud request from the thunder client is handled with a reply 


**** always module.export the router from all routes files else error
