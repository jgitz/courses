/*  
in an html page.... every action we does has a default result..... for example... if we rignt click context menu appears.... if we click a link , it routes to that link..... these are default behaviors.... but if you want to change the default behavior to any other behavior, first we want to disable the default behavior and for that we use prevent default method.... usually we use it in arrow function 

        (e) => {
            e.preventDefault()
        }
