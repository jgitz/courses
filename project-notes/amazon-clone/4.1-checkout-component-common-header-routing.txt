when you create the basket button, there should be a page to checkout....

    - the page is divided into two sides.

        - left side has
            - an advertisement image at top
            - a title
            - cart contents listed
        

        -right side has
            - the total price
            - this order contains gift checkbox
            -a proceed to checkout button
            (all will be made into a subtotal component)

create checkout component and it's css file

list it inside app.js path for  checkout

goto app.js since header component is common to all components....... delist it from route and place it outside the ROUTES TAG
