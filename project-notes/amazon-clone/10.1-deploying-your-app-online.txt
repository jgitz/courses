even though we need some more updates in the app.... we decide to do it after deploying it online....

- open terminal from your project folder.. (**** check error part at end)
    - run command 
        :: firebase login ::

        - firebase login appears on browser... login to firebase account


    - run command 
        - :: firebase init ::
        - select HOSTING CONFIGURE OPTION.... press enter
        - choose existing project.... select project and click enter
        - in next line (what do you want) type :: build ::

        - **** configure as a single page *** YES
        - github deployment :: N ?? ::

- now type command 
    :: npm run build ::

- after building an app.... if we do any change to the app.... you have to run command :: npm run build :: again and again

- now to deploy the app... type command..
    :: firebase deploy ::


***** error to run firebase commands in project folder do
            - remove the file C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\npm\ng.ps1
            - run command :: npm cache clear --force

**** after building an app.... if we do any change to the app code .... you have to run command :: npm run build :: again and again
