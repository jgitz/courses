now we need our app to create a new user in firebase website.... when you click CREATE NEW AMAZON ACCOUNT BUTTON.... so we need to write firebase code inside the register function in LOGIN page....

- goto login.js....import auth from firebase 

-goto login.js.... inside register function (linked to on click of create account button).... write firebase code to pass in email and password to register a new user in firebase website....
    auth
    .createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
    .then((auth) =>{
        console.log(auth);
    })
    .catch((error) => alert(error.message))
        - in the above code the email and password is passed to firebase website.
        - if the user is created an object is returned and we console log that object.. if success the object is printed
        - if the object is not recieved the error message is displayed using catch

        - now check if the create button is working by typing email and password... then click the create button.... if it works.... there'll be an object inside the console

        - now as we click create.. we need to route to HOME page.... so we have to use USE NAVIGATE HOOK inside REGISTER FUNCTION AUTH... inside login component.
            - import useNavigate from react-router-dom

            - before main return
                const navigate = useNavigate()

            - inside register function.... inside auth....

                 if (auth) { 
                 navigate("/") 
                }
            - now the site will route to home page after creation of account

- now inside the login.js.... inside sign in funciton.... write firebase authentication codes like register.... 
    - here we use firebase command 
        auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword
