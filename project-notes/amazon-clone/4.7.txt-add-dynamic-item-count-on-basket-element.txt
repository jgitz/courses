now the basket state array length is equal to the number of items in the cart.... now use it to give basket count in header component....

- goto header.js component.... import useState from stateprovider.js....

- inside header component.... before main return..... use the useState command to pull the states from reducer....
**** here the curly {} around the state is important.... else error

- goto header.js.... goto basket count tag.... instead of 0..... write basket?.length 
    **** ? is known as OPTIONAL CHAINING.... i.e even if the basket object has error... it only returns undefined instead of making error in program 

- now click the add to cart button and see basket count increasing in the nav bar ( header component )

**** here the curly {} around the state is important.... else error
