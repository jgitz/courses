now we need to design the payment component to which we are routed when we click proceed to checkout button inside the subtotal component.

- goto payment.js and design the following
    - divide the page into 3 sections
        - one to display address
        - one to display the cart items
        - one for PAYMENT detaila (to be used by stripejs)

- inside payment.js import 
    - payment.css
    - useStateValue()

- inside payment.js.. before the main return pull basket state and user from reducer using useStateValue

- inside payment.js... at top... add a heading with dynamic display of number of items... and set a link to the checkout component

- inside the section reserved for display of cart item... place the CHECKOUT PRODUCT component using map method and basket state

- inside payment.css.... design the css
