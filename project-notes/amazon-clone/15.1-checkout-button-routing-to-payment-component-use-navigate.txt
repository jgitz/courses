now we need to add payment page.... we have a proceed to checkout button on SUBTOTAL component.... make a payment component.... set the route in app component.... use NAVIGATE form react router dom to cofigure PROCEED to checkout button in subtotal component to route to the new payment component

- create new comopnent named payment.js.... and payment.css

- goto app.js.... set a route tag to payment component with path "/payment"

- goto subtotal component....
    - import useNavigate from react-router-dom
    - before main return, set variable named navigate to useNavigate hook
    - on proceed to checkout button.... set an onclick to.... ARROW FUNCTION.... navigate("/payment")

**** USE NAVIGATE IS IMPORTED
***** always assign imported useNavigate variable to a variable
****** onclick only takes an ARROW FUNCTION as the value....
