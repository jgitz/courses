 now we have to create an authentication page i.e login page.... so we make a component....

 - make a component named login.js and login.css

 - inside app.js.... make a route with path "/login"

 - inside the header.js.... link the sign in tag to login page using link tag....

 - but the login page don't need nav bar.... so inside app.js we have to remove the common navbar from routes and add it individually to the needed routes using {[]} inside elements attribute

 - inside the login.js.... construct the page body with 
    - amazon logo linked to home page
    - email and password input
    - sign in button
    - create amazon account button
    - disclaimer text


- to store user and password in variables.... inside login.js.... import usestate from react
    - set email and password variables using usestate as EMPTY STRING.
    - connect the email and password fields with use state variables using VALUE TAG attribute
    - now inside email input tag....set ONCHANGES attribute....now write an ARROW function TO SET EMAIL varible.... do the same for PASSWORD

    - inside sign in button add attribute type = submit

    - inside the signin button.... assign an onclick attribute to a function called signIn.... now before main return..... write a sign in arrow function to prevent RELOAD using the command.... :: preventDefault() ::.... also inside the function reserve space for FIREBASE CODE .... do the same for create account buttton
