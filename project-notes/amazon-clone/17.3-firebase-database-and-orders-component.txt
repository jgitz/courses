now we are planning to store our order cart details and our payment details inside the firebase cloud database.... so we need to setup firebase cloud....


- goto firebase account.... select firebase database from the left side (double stripe icon)....
    - click create database...
    - click test mode 
    - select the nearest region

    - now database is made in firebase in the cloud

- goto payment.js....
    - import DB object from firebase.js
    - inside handle submit function.... inside payment intent..... before all the codes inside....
        - add firebase codes to push no sql order data into the firebase cloud db...
            - here we make a collection of users.... then store in the logged in user id.... then for this user id, we create a collection for his cartorders... then inside his orders, we store payment intent id to identify the payments.... and set the following inside an object...
                - basket (from basket)
                - amount  (from paymentIntent.amount) 
                - order time stamp (from paymentIntent.created) 

- now goto amazon website.... add items... pay .... now check if a database is created in your online firebase database....
