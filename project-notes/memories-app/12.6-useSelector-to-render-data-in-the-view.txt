now we have used dispatch actions inside useEffect to load posts data inside the app component.... now we need to display it inside the posts component....


- goto client/src/components/posts.js

    - import useSelector from react-redux

    - inside the component function..... before the main return

      - declare a variable named posts and assign it useSelector with combined reducer posts key inside it like this.... and console.log(posts) to check if store is working

        const posts = useSelector((state) => state.posts)

        console.log(posts)

** run react app inside browser... if an empty posts [] is displayed inside the console.... your app is working

**** now run the react app in browser.... inside console if an empty [] is displayed and a network error is displayed...

  goto server/index.js.... check if app.use(posts) is declared before app.use(cors).... if so ..... make app.use(posts) come after app.use(cors)

    ** order of app.use matter inside the server index.js
