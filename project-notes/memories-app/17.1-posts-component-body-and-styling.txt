.... now we've set set codes to create posts from frontend and store posts details in backend..... 

.... now we need the front end to fetch post details from the backend and display it in posts component


.... we've already loaded the post details from the store using the useSelector hook.... now we need to use that to display the posts from the state


- goto posts folder

  - inside the postsStyle.js.... define the styles inside a nested object named classes

  - goto posts.js 

      - import postsStyle style

      - import post.js component

      - import mui components grid and circular progress

      - now inside main return.... in a conditional.... define a ternary oprtator such that it shows circular progress if there is no post in loaded state..... else define a grid and map the items from the state and enclose post component inside a grid and give in the state as prop for the post component

      - add appropriate sx prop to each mui component
