now we need to use axios to link the generated client to backend url....


- inside client/src folder

  - make a new folder named api-axios.... to store axios file

  - goto new folder client/src/api

    - make a new file named axios.js.... to store axios codes

    - goto api/axios.js

      - import axios from axios

      - declare a variable to store full backend url.... i.e http://localhost:5000/posts

        const url = "http://localhost:5000/posts"

      - declare a variable named fetchPosts to store an arrow function with axios.get from url.... and self export it

       export  const fetchPosts = () => axios.get(url)
