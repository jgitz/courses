now we need to design the app.js component using material ui....

the app.js body should contain 
    - a navbar with text memories
    - an image
    - posts component
    - form component


goto src/app.js
    - import necessary mui components
    - goto public/index.html and add head link tag for roboto font as Typography in mui uses roboto font
    - wrap the entire page in a container component
    - the posts and form components are made into grid
