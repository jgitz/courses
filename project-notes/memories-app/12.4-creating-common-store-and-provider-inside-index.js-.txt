now we need a store to push all the states into it....

.... store is created using createStore() from redux

.... createStore() takes 2 arguments

  1) reducers from combine reducers
  2) compose(applyMiddleware(thunk)) to specify middleware

    ** here the middleware used is thunk

.... now inorder to provide this store to all components.... we use <Provider> tag from react-redux


..... here to provide store to whole of app.... we make store inside index.js


- goto src/index.js

  - import Provider from react-redux

  - import legacy_createStore, applyMiddleware and compose from redux

  - import thunk from "redux-thunk"

  - import reducers from combineReducers.js

  - make store variable and use legacy_createStore() and compose(applyMiddleware(thunk)) to create store with thunk to have a store with asynchronous capabilities

  - wrap the <App/> component inside <Provider> tag and add a prop to provider which calls newly created store

    ** <Provider> tag provides store to the whole app component
