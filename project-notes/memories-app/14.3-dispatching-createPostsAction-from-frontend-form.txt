now we've created an action to do.... this action must be triggered from the frontend i.e from the forms component....

.... we want the form to dispatch the form inputs when the form is submitted.... hence we've to dispatch the data from handleSubmit()


- goto client/src/components/form/Form.js

  - import useDispatch hook from react-redux

  - import createPostsAction from createPostsAction.js

  - before the main return make a variable named dispatch and assign it useDispatch

  - goto handleSubmit() arrow function.... inside the function block

    - use e.preventDefault() to prevent page refresh on form submission

    - use dispatch(createPostsAction(postData)) to dispatch post data from the form component to the reducer.... like this

        const handleSubmit = (e) => {
            e.preventDefault() /* 14.3 */

            dispatch(createPostsAction(postData)) /* 14.3 */
          }
