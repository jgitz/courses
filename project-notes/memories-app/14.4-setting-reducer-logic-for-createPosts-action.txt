.... now we've created action.... configured dispatch for action from frontend.... now we've to set logic for the action inside the reducer with switch case


- goto client/src/reducers/postsReducer.js


  - create a new case for action.type "CREATE_POSTS"

  - inside the case

    -  return the spread of all data in posts state along with the action.payload


** now run the backend

** run the frontend

** create a post and submit in the frontend

** check mongoose database for your post data inside collection.... if found... then success


***** check the routes of backend for get or post request spellings.... else infinite get requests from the frontend console

***** if there is a new field to be added to server end mongodb schema..... first delete the entire db from the mongo atlas.... add the new field in schema and try again
