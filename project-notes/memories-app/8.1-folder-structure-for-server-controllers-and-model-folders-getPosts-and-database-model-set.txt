best practice is to make separate folders for programming logic and database.... so we need to make 2 folders
    1) controllers folder : to hold logic js files
    2) model folder : to make a schema and model of our database


- goto server folder....
    - create a folder named controllers

    - goto controllers folder

        - create a file named posts.js to store logics

        - goto routes/posts.js
            
            - cut the logic of router.get...
                *** i.e the codes after "/"

        - goto controllers/posts.js

            - create an export variable named GETPOSTS and paste the logic that we cut from /routes/posts.js (previous setup)

        - again goto routes/posts.js

            - import getPosts variable from /controllers/posts.js

            - inside the router.get.... after "/".... after a comma.... add the imported getPosts variable

- goto server folder

    - create a new folder named models.... to store mongoose schema and models for various actions

    - goto models folder

        - create a new file named postMessage.js to specify the schema and make model db for someone posting a new memory

        - goto postMessage.js

            - import mongoose

            - to create a schema for memory posts.... make a variable postSchema using (**) new mongoose.Schema()
                

                - inside mongoose.Schema method... create the schema of db entries inside an object.... schema includes
                    - title, message, creator as strings

                    - tags as an ARRAY of strings

                    -  a property named SELECTED FILE is made to post MEMORY PHOTO....**** its value is given as STRING.... because we use base 64 to convert image to string

                    - for like count....we make an object with key likeCount.... which has 2 properties.... 1) type with type NUMBER 2) default with value 0.

                    - for date we create an object with key createdAt.... the object has two properties.... 1) type : Date 2) default: new Date

                - to make model out of the schema named postSchema use.... mongoose.model()....

                    - make a variable named
                    
                         PostMessage = mongoose.model("PostMessage", postSchema)
                            *** P is uppercase in PostMessage variable
                - export default the model named PostMessage
                
                    **** now we can do actions like find, create, delete.... etc on PostMessage model database







***** in nodejs always add .js extension for imported js files.... don't ommit like in react files.... else console error
