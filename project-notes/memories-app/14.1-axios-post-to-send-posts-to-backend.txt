now we've setup front end to create post.... now we need to send this new post details to backend.... so first we need to set endpoint towards the backend

- goto client/src/axios/axios.js

    - add a new variable named createPosts and assign an arrow function with axios.post(url) to the backend like this

      export const createPosts = (newPostData) => axios.post(url, newPostData) 

      ** here we send the new post data along with the url
