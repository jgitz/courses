.... any spelling errors in action types won't get displayed in console.... so store all action types inside a separate file as variables and use the variables for action types inside the action files


- inside client/src folder

      - create new folder named constants 

            - inside constant folder

                - write all action types as named export variables 

- goto each action files and replace all the types with the variables inside the constants folder

- goto each reducer files and replace all the types in case statements with variables from constants folder
