now we need to create the front end

our website home page will have

    - posts component : a big home component where all memories posts.... and a small image 

    - post component : individual memory post inside posts component (home page)

    - form component : form to create new post


now for good practice we create a folder structure to keep components.

.. images are saved inside separate folder

.. folder of a child component is created inside the folder of the parent component (i.e post component folder is made inside the posts component folder)

****.. here we use material ui for ui design.... so component css is defined inside STYLES.JS for EACH component and NOT inside .css file


- goto client/src folder

    - make a folder named image...

        - download the image for posts page from this link: 

            - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianhajdin/project_mern_memories/master/client/src/images/memories.png?token=AF56X74XONEUGZ4FD2FUIA27UURPI

- goto client/src

    - make a folder named components... to store components

    - goto client/src/components folder

        - make folder named Form to store

            - create Form.js and formStyles.js files

            - inside Form.js do rfce

        - make a folder named posts

            - create Posts.js and PostsStyles.js files

            - inside Posts.js do rfce


            - inside posts folder

                - create another folder named post.... to store post component

                    - create Post.js and postStyles.js

                    - inside Post.js do rfce
