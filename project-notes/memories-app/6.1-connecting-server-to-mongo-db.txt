now we need to connect the mongodb cloud cluster to our server side application....

- goto mongo atlas website.... login
    - click databases tab on left pane
        - on your cluster, click connect

        - select option "connect your application"
            ** because we want db to connect to server side node application

        - copy the connection starting

- goto server folder....open index.js
    - make a const variable named CONNECTION_URL and assign it the COPIED string from mongodb

    - now inside the pasted string..... replace the username and password with the USERNAME and PASSWORD that you gave at DATABASE ACCESS (not google account password)

        **** this line is vulnerable.... so later we'll store it as an environmental variable

    - now we need a variable named PORT to set port on which our server will run
        - we set either AN ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE to link HEROKU port (to be set later) or port 5000 (to work while testing)

    - now to set up mongoose.... use mongoose.connect()
        - this has two parameters...
            1) connection_url variable
            2) an object with two options
                - useNewUrlParser: true;
                - useUnifiedTopology: true;

                    **** not required but to prevent error/warning messages in console
        
        - add .then callback codes if mongoose connects to db
            - for express app to listen to port and show a console log that server is running

        - add .catch callback codes to display error.message

        - add the following line on index.js to prevent error/warnings in console

            - mongoose.set("useFindAndModify", false)
            ***** this line no longer needed so commented

- now to start the server app running.... goto server folder open the terminal.... type
    - npm start

        ** npm start because in package.json file we added script that START command refers to COMMAND: :: nodemon index.js


***** change port number

**** comment the line ....  mongoose.set
("useFindAndModify", false).... it is a legacy code

**** enter correct password in CONNECTION_URL variable
