.... now we've created action for current id..... its logic should be written inside a reducer


- goto src/reducers folder 

      - create a new file currentIdReducer.js

      - inside src/reducers/currentIdReducer.js 

          - write the following code to set reducer function with currentId state initial state and action as parameters.... use switch on basis of action.type.... implement the logic like this


              
                export const currentIdReducer = (currentId = null, action) => { 
                  switch (action.type) { 
                    case "CURRENT_ID": 

                      return action.payload

                    default:
                      return currentId 
                  }

                  
                }
      
      - goto src/reducers/combineReducers.js 

          - import currentIdreducer

          - add the new currentIdReducer as currentId inside the combineReducer method after already defined posts reducer after a comma like this

              export default combineReducers({ 
                posts,
                currentId: currentIdReducer
              })

.... now we need to dispatch action from the frontend to trigger this reducer to store currentId state in the store
