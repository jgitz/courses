.... to make a state called currentId.... we need an action and reducer.... here we configure action for current id 


- goto src/actions folder 

    - create new file called currentIdAction.js

    - inside src/actions/currentIdAction.js 

        - add the following action creator function with currentId parameter and return action object with type and payload like this 

            export const currentIdAction = (currentId) => { 
                          return {
                            type: "CURRENT_ID", 
                            payload: currentId 
                          }
                          }

.... now we need to set reducer for currentId action to set its business logic
