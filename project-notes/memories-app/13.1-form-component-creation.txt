 .... the form will have the following inputs

  - creator named
  - title
  - message
  - tags
  - select photo file (using filebase tag from react-file-base64 )

  - submit button
  - clear button

    ** all this form inputs should be stored inside an object and be sent to the backend database



- goto client/components/forms.js

    - import the following material ui components

        - paper
        - typography
        - textField
        - Button

        

    - import FileBase tag from react-file-base64..... to select image and save it as string

    - import useState to make a variable to store the form input data

    - before the main return make a variable postData and setPostDAta using useState hook with initial values like this

      const [postData, setPostDAta] = useState({
        creator:"",
        title: "",
        message:"",
        imageFile: ""

      })

        
    - now use paper tag as a container

    - inside the paper tag

      - make html form component

      - inside the form component

        - make a typography for form title

        - make 4 inputs using text fields for creator, title message and tags

          - ** each input has a value and onChange attribute pointing to its initial state value and handler function respectively

          - outside the main return write the handler function for each inputs to store the input value in state variable

        - make a div to set image file selection

        - inside the div

          - use <FileBase/> tag like this

              <FileBase 
                type="file"
                multiple={false}
                onDone={(base64) => setPostData({....<postData, <selectedFile>: base64 >})}
              />
        
        - make an mui button with type submit
