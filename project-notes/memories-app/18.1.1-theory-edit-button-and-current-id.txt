**** in the youtube video.... he don't use the redux to pass in current id.... so trying to implement redux for current id state by OURSELVES 

.... we've now set 3 dot button for editing a POST.... so what we have to implement in frontend is 

    1) on click of 3 dot.... a new state named currentId must be created.... currentId should store the id of the clicked post INSIDE store (action and reducers and combine reducers should be configured)

    2) when ... button of a post is clicked.... it should automatically fill in the FORM INPUT FIELDS with its values
