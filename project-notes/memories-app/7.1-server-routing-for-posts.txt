now we need to set a separate files for posts (??)..... then set a route to it with / .... but use the middleware in index.js to add a prefix /posts to the post.js route

- inside server folder.
    - create a folder named routes

    - inside routes folder... make a file named posts.js


- goto posts.js

    - import express

    - create router variable usint express.Router();

    - using router variable set a get route with route as / and with req and res function and send a message using res.send....

    - export default router variable

- goto index.js

    - import postRoutes(??) from posts.js

    - using middleware app.use.... assign /posts route to the imported postRoutes from posts.js


        ** now to access if it is working.... open browser and goto url : localhost:5000/posts
