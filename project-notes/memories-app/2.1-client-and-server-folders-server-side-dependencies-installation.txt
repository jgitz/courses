- inside memories-app folder.... make 2 folders for front end and backend
    - make folder named "client" for front end
    
    - make folder named "server" for backend

- install latest node by downloading it from web

- goto server folder.....
    - create a file named index.js.... this is the starting file of our backend

    - to create package.json file inside the server folder.... open terminal from server folder and type
        - :: npm init -y ::

        **** this file holds all the dependencies used in backend

    - now we need to install dependency packages for backend.... the dependency packages are

        - body-parser : middleware to send post requests.... to handle http post requests in express.js we need this.... body-parser middleware extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request and filters only req.body....

        - cors : to send cross origin requests

        - express : backend nodejs framework to set routing of our application

        - mongoose : to create models for our post..... we use cloud ATLAS db of mongodb

        - nodemon : to automatically reset the server upon any change made in the backend code

            - to install all in one go.... goto terminal and type
                - :: npm i body-parser cors express mongoose nodemon ::

    - inside server folder.... inside package.json.... add these two lines
        - after key named main add this line
            - "type": "module", ** comma is important
                ***** so we can use traditional react import syntax instead of require syntax

            - inside the "scripts" key
                - remove the existing test line
                - add the line
                    - "start": "nodemon index.js"

    - now goto server folder.... open index.js and import all the dependencies installed
