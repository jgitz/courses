now logic of getPost is to see all the posts that are created.

i.e... postMessage is the database which has all memories post.... we've to list its contents using mongodb method find()

- goto controllers/posts..

    - import PostMessage from models/PostMessage.js.... i.e database model

    - make getPost variable async

    - inside getPost arrow function block

        - make try and catch block

        - inside try block... make a variable named postMessages (**** p is lower case)

            - make the newly created postMessage variable as AWAIT.... and assign PostMessage.find() (**P is uppercase as it is database model***) method to it....

                *** this find() means get all contents of database model

            - assign res.status as 200 and return postMessage as json

        - inside catch block

            - assign status code 404

            - return json message 
                {message: error.message}

    ** now if we goto browser you should see an EMPTY ARRAY []
