..... now that we've set actions and reducers for currentId.... we need to dispatch the action from front ent..... to do that we need to do the following 

        1) store the currentId of the post in a variable 

        2) create a handleEdit function for 3 dot button... such that it sets the currentId variable with the id value of the post and dispatch the currentId action function with that id value 

        3) to prevent DOUBLE CLICKING to set currentId in store.... we need a USE EFFECT HOOK which DISPATCHES CURRENT ID action whenever the CURRENTID variable value changes


- goto src/components/posts/post/post.js component 

    - import the following

          - useState from react
          - useDispatch from react-redux 
          - currentIdAction from actions
         

    - before the main return.... use USE STATE hook to create a new variable named CURRENTID to store the id of the clicked post

        const [currentId, setCurrentId] = useState(null)


    - before the main return.... create a dispatch variable and assign useDispatch() to use the dispatch functionality

    - inside the main return.... goto 3 dot button element and set the onClick to handleEdit function which we'll define in the next step 

    - before the main return.... define the handleEdit function such that it sets the CurrentId STATE variable from the post._id value (from the prop parameter) from the store.... like this

          const handleEdit = () => {
             
              const postId = post._id 
              dispatch(currentIdAction(postId));
              
            } /* 18.1.4 */

                ***** always make it a habit to store outside value as a separate variable inside a function..... here it is postId
