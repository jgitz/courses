now we need to set action to dispatch type and payload to 


- goto client/src/actions folder

  - create a new action file named createPostsAction.js

  - open createPostsAction.js

    - import * as axios from client/src/axios/axios.js

    - create a new createPostsAction arrow function.... and curry in the async(dispatch) to use thunk capabilities....

    - inside the curried arrow function

      - create a try catch block

      - inside the try block

        - make a await variable named data to fetch the data from the backend using the createPost axios function defined inside axios file... like this

          const createPosts = (newPost) => async (dispatch) => { /* 14.2 */
  try {
    const data = await axios.createPosts(newPost)

          ** here we send newPost data to axios...... then to backend

        - use dispatch() to dispatch the action with type "CREATE_POSTS" and payload the awaited data

      - inside the catch block

        - console log the error.message
