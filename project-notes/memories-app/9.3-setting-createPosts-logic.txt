now logic of createPost is that... we need to create a new memory post with inputs such as title, photo etc...

.. we put this inputs in the front end.... and is transferred to the backend....

.. at backend... our inputs are inside request body.... backend logic need to fetch the inputs

... these body inputs must be saved inside a variable

.... now we need to add it into our database model.... so we do it by creating a new variable....then assign it NEW KEY word with <database_model_variable>(<body_input_variable>)


.... and to save this new post data inside the db.... use save()


- goto controllers/posts-controller.js

    - make createPost async

    - inside createPost arrow function block

        - make a variable named POST to store req.body.... ie data inputs from frontend

        - to make a new data use the code

            - const newPost = new PostMessage(post) **** check keyword new

        - make a try and catch block

        - inside try.... inorder to save the new data into database add this code

            - await newPost.save()

            - make res.status as 201... and return new data in json format

        - inside catch.... make res.status as 409... and return json message {message: error.message}


** we can't see the output as we have not set the body to give inputs to create database... so now we have to setup frontend to do that
