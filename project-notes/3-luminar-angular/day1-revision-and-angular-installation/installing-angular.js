//step1: to setup angular, we need a ide.. here we use vscode

//step2: next we need to install a packet manager to use 3rd party libraries inside your angular project.... we use npm (node packet manager) packet manager..... if we've installed nodejs inside your system, npm is already installed in it..

//step3: we need to specify the language to be used in angular.... we use typescript ( open source language maintained by microsoft)..... typescript is same as js but, we can declare the type of variables inside it...

note: what is transpiling? : webpage can only interpret js ... conversion of typescript to javascript inside angular to render webpage is called transpiling..js

//step4: install angular cli..via windows command: npm i -g @angular/cli@latest

//step5: to check if angular cli is installed in your system in cli type.... ng --version

// **note: if you can't run ng --version command in powershell or integrated terminal... remove the file  C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\npm\ng.ps1.... then type npm cache clean --force.... now again run ng --version..
