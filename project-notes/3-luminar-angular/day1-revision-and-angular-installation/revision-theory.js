// what is web application?
 : applications that run on a web server

// what is the use of html? 
: used to set the front end view of a web app

// what is css : 
used to style the html elements

// what is bootstrap? : 
is a css framework that gives us a predefined set of classes. 

// what is use of javascript : 
it decides the behavior of your web page. eg what happens when a certain event happens in your web page

// what are the main components of web application :
frontend(client side), backend (server side) and database

// explain MEARN Stack: 
Angular -> UI framework based on js used to develop the frontend of desktop and mobile web applications.... we use html, css and js inside it in a specific format.
react -> another framework like angular to develop frontend
nodejs.express -> to create backend
mongodb -> to handle database.. it's main speciality is that it stores data in JSON format
expressjs -> is a backend js framework which works on node.js



// what happens when you log in to fb page: 
when you enter login credentials and click login...... when we click log in fb server checks if our login credentials exists inside the backend database of fb server......

// what is the use of front end technologies (html, css, angular, react, vue.js, next.js, php, java, asp.net) : 
it is only used to give a graphical view of your web page and send client requests to the backend(server side)....... front end technologies cannot resolve more than one request at a time..... so we use backend technologies to handle multiple requests.....

// eg of backend tech:
 php, java, python, node.js, express.js

// use of backend technologies:
 to resolve multiple requests coming from client side

// is frontend and backend hosted inside same system :
 No! for eg facebook front end can be accecced by the client device. But, its backend is inside facebook server.....

// what is use of API (Application programming interface): 
used to forward client request from frontend to the backend...... analogy: in a hotel, customer=frontend client, api = waiter, backend = kitchen

// what is http : 
it is a protocol followed by requests which are send from frontend to backend through internet..
 
// what is  the use of JSON (javascript object notations) and XML :
 these are data transfer formats to send data between frontend and backend via api's through the network/internet


// what is backend technology used in MEARN stack: 
we use express.js which is based on node.js

// what is database :
 a technology used to store large amount of permanent data and do data manipulations on the stored data

// example of database technologies: 
SQL, MySQL, oracle, mongodb, postgresSQL

// where is database hosted ? : 
it may or may not be in same backend device...
