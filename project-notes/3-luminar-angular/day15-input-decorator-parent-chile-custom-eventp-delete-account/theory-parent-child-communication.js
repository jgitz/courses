// to communicate between html,ts files of WITHIN a component, we use BINDING

// to communicate and link TS file of 2 DIFFERENT components, we use DEPENDENCY INJECTION (inside constructor () {})

// WHAT is PARENT CHILD communication: when we want to display/call an HTML page of one component INSIDE HTML page of ANOTHER COMPONENT, this is called PARENT - CHILD communication.... for eg: we create a DELETE ACCOUNT button inside the DASHBOARD.... BUT when it is CLICKED, we want to display A CONFIRMATION BOX with YES or No whose VIEW is defined by HTML page of ANOTHER component.... here DASHBOARD HTML is the PARENT and VIEW of DELETE ACCOUNT is the CHILD....
