/* 
// everything in ts is objects

// common things in a program is called class

// ts uses classes

// we make objects from classes using constructors

// first we define a class with all properties and variables defined inside it.... next using CONSTRUCTOR METHOD we make object from the class.... when we invoke a class, the CONSTRUCTOR METHOD inside the class gets executed first even if it is defined further down the line of code..... 

// the order of arrangement of variables methods and constructor method is....1st we write CONSTRUCTOR METHOD... then we write all the user defined variables and methods....

// each ts file of angular will have.... a class under which SELECTORS:, TEMPLATEURLS: and STYLEURLS:[] is defined..
