// For effective organisation of data we use various data structures.

// Data structures are classified into two. 1) Linear Data Structures 2) Non Linear Data Structures.

// 1) Linear DS: Datas are stored in consecutive adjacent memory locations.
// .. eg var array = [10, 20] is an array and an example of linear data structure. The values can be accessed sequencially via index numbers

//.. common Linear DS
/* -array
    -stack
    -queue
    -linked list */

//2) Non Linear DS: Datas are not stored in consecutive memory locations.
// .. eg var arr = {"one": 10, "two":20} is not an array and cannot be accessed via index numbers. Here arr is an object because it is enclosed in curly brackets.

//.. common Non Linear DS
/* -tree
    -graph 
*/
