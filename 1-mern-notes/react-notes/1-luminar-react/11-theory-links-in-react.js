/* 
in old web pages.... we use HREF to divert the page to another location on click.... but in react.... we enclose component codes inside <Link> tag... and an attribute named.... to = {"path"}

.....to use it LINK TAG should be imported from REACT-ROUTER-DOM... 

syntax:

<Link to = {path}>

codes

<Link/>
