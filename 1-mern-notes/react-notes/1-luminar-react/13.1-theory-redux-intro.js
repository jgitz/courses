What is REDUX?: Redux is a state management tool. Common functions used by many components are stored using Redux.....
                ..... REDUX is used to avoid PROPS drilling.... 


What is PROPS drilling: without a state management tool... data from one component can only be sent to another component by multiple using props in multiple components.... this has a risk of break in data flow if one component fails...

What are the main components of redux?: there are 3 basic pillar  JS file for redux.. they are
                            1) ACTION FILE
                            2) REDUCER FILE
                            3) STORE FILE

Explain the functioning of REDUX... HOW is a DATA from a component is pushed into STORE FILE: REDUNDANT FUNCTIONS are stored inside ACTION FILE.... 

.....whenever a component wants to invoke the FUNCTION of an ACTION file.... the COMPONENT invokes that function by DISPATCHING THE ACTION..

.. when the function from the action file gets executed its OUTPUT is known as PAYLOAD..... the PAYLOAD is sent to the REDUCER FILE....

... REDUCER FILE has FUNCTION with 2 ARGUMENTS.... one argument is an EMPTY STATE.... and the other argument is ACTION.... the payload is PUSHED into EMPTY STATE....the OUTPUT of REDUCER file is UPDATED STATE....

.... UPDATED STATE is sent to the STORE FILE....

***** now components can access pushed data from STORE file....

***** in a project src folder... we manually need to create action.js, reducer.js and store.js......
****** there can only be ONE store.js file..... but there can be many action and reducer files....
