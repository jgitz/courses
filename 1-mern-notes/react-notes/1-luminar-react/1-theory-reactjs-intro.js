/* 
- reactjs is NOT a framework. It is a LIBRARY.

- difference between a library and a framework is that. In a framework, the developer has got no control. Everything is done by set of rules laid by framework. But, in a library the control of codes is with the developer.

- building blocks of a website made with reactjs is components.

- angular uses REAL dom and REACTJS uses VIRTUAL DOM
