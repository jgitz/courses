..... in manual web app building you need to configure many tools into your react app project to BUILD IT.....like

    - BABEL: for transpiling the jsx to html and js

    - WEBPACK: configuration library to set the configuration 

.... for a beginner... this is a cumbersome process.... so a solution is to have a tool that does all this automatically.... and that tool is CREATE REACT APP 

- CREATE REACT APP: is a package that automatically sets up REACT with package runner command npx (node package executer)

    ** it uses BABEL and WEBPACK to build your app
