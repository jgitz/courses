- FRAMEWORK: 

      ** is an ecosystem with inbuilt tools that are needed for development 

          ** eg Angular.... it has many inbuilt tools 

      ** less freedom for developers as the developers have to code in the way that framework says



- LIBRARY: 

    ** does only one thing

          ** eg: REACTJS library only deals with the UI design

    ** there are no built in features other than its primary functionality....

            ** to use more features.... you have to install seaparate libraries.... 

                  ** eg: in react we use... axios for data fetching..... jest for testing..... redux for state management

    ** developers have more freedom to add and remove features using 3rd party libraries
