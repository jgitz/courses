- in react we can make components of functional type or classical type 

- FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT: component js file has a main function that returns the component view we want to see inside the FUNCTION RETURN 

- JSX: is an extension of js syntax that allows you to use html syntax inside the react component 

    ** the return block of functional component is written in JSX 

- React.createElement() : is the utility function used by react in backstage to convert jsx to html 

    ** it takes 3 arguments

          1) the element tag as string

          2) attribute 

          3) text content 

    ** eg

          React.createElement("h1", null, "hiii")

              ** makes an H1 tag with text hiii

    ** using this inside main return of functional component also works
