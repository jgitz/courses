.... watch it

-  HIGHER ORDER COMPONENT: in react higher order component is a SIMPLE FUNCTION which 

    - takes a simple COMPONENT as ARGUMENT 

    - then the COMPONENT is TRANSFORMED as an ENHANCED COMPONENT...

    - the codes to create a HOC is in CLASSICAL COMPONENT syntax

** this is used before HOOKS came into react... so there is a chance that we find this in legacy code
