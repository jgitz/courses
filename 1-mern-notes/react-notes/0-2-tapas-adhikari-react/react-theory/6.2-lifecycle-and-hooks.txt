- LIFECYCLE in react: are certain points in react process which we can access and do operations 

** in CLASS components we use METHODS like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount etc to hook into react life cycles 

** in FUNCTIONAL components we use APPROPRIATE HOOKS in various SCENARIOS like below....

        - when functional components mounts : we useEffect hook

        - when state of functional components changes  : we use useState hook

        - when props of functional components changes 

        - when context or store changes

        - when functional component unmounts

** lifecycles and functional component hooks 

  - MOUNTING PHASE: is when a component is created and inserted into the dom 

    - main hooks used in mounting phase are 
        - useState to add state to the component 

        - useEffect hook effect function is used to handle any sideeffect BASED on the dependency array 

        - useRef: create a mutable referenct to a value in the DOM 

  - UPDATING PHASE : occurs when there is a PROP OR STATE change in the functional component 

    - main hooks used in updating state are 

       - useState hook to update the state 

       - useEffect hooks effect function to run update codes 

  - UNMOUNTING PHASE: occurs when a functional component is removed from the DOM

    - main hooks used in unmounting phase are 

      - useEffect hook's CLEANUP FUNCTION (this is inside the return of the effect function)
