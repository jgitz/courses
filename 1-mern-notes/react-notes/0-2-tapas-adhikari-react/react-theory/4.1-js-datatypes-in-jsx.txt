.... main return of functional component interprets jsx..... so if we want to use js variables and datatypes (declared before main return) inside return.... we've to follow the following syntax 

- to use js variables.... enclose it in curly {}

    {variable}

- to use js comment.... enclose it inside curly {}

    {/* comment */}

- jsx WON'T display js RESERVED WORD like TRUE... NULL.... UNDEFINED as STRING unless it is converted to string like this....

    {String(true)}

- if you specify a variable with array of strings in jsx inside {}.... the output will be array element strings merged into one without space

- jsx DON'T allow IF ELSE STATEMENTS

    ** instead TERNARY OPERATORS and SHORTCIRCUITING is supported

- jsx DON'T allow LOOP STATEMENTS like FOR WHILE etc 

    ** instead use ARRAY MAP method with KEY PROPERTY inside element tag
