 ..... using of context in react is ONE method to provide data to components globally WITHOUT PROPS DRILLING
 
 - what is context?

   ** context is some information which is available GLOBALLY 

   ** in react a context can be created 

        - GLOBALLY which is accessible to ALL the components 

        - PARTIALLY accessible to SELECTED components

   ** there can be MULTIPLE CONTEXTS created inside an application 

  
- what are the INGREDIENTS to implement context to react components? 

    .... there are 3 ingredients to enable data gloabally available to all the components using context.... they are 

      1) CONTEXT: holds the INFORMATION/DATA which you want make available globally.... context is created by using the react api from
        
         React.createContext(<initaial value>) 

            ** initial value can be of any datatype

      2) CONTEXT PROVIDER: is an HTML WRAPPER which wraps the component where you want the context data to be provided 

          ** the context provider tag has an ATTRIBUTE named VALUE to which we give the data holding variable as value 

          ** component AS WELL AS its CHILD components will get the data from the CONTEXT

      3) useContext HOOK: is a hook used to EXTRACT the data from the context to use it inside the component 


***** use context only when there is a need to pass data DEEP down the NESTING heirarchy.... else USE PROPS for small nesting
