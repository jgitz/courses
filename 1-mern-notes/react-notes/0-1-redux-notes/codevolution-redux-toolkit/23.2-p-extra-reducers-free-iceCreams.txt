... to practice extra reducer....let the shopkeeper give a free icecream with purchase of a cake..... implement a case in iceCream slice such that when one cake is purchased the icecream number reduce by 1

- goto iceCreamSlice.js

  - require cakeActions from cakeSlice.js

  - inside iceCreamSlice createSlice({})

    - make extraReducers object and implement logic with builder arrow function like this

      extraReducers: (builder) => { /* 23.2 */
        builder.addCase(cakeActions.ordered, (state) => {
          state.noOfIceCreams--
      })


  - test it by running command

    :: node index.js

**** named import of cakeActions is like this

        const cakeActions = require("../cake/cakeSlice.js").cakeActions
