in redux-toolkit the actions and reducers of a feature is stored inside a single js file with file name format 

  <featureName>Slice.js


- goto projectFolder/features/cake folder

  - create new js file named cakeSlice.js

      ** this file will hold actions and reducers of the cake feature

  - goto cakeSlice.js

      - import createSlice method from @reduxjs/toolkit

      - set initial state object of cake with number of cake set as 10

      - make cakeSlice variable to store slice properties suchas name, initial state and reducer using the method createSlice({})

      - inside cakeSlice variable
          - make an object 

          - inside the object set slice properties

            - name
            - initial state
            - reducer

          - inside the reducer property

            - each action type name is set as key

            - the value of action type key is an arrow functio with state and action as props 

            - there is no return for arrow function.... just write the logic

      - use 2 module.exports

        - one default export to export for slice reducers

        - one named export to export slice actions

***** inside cakeSlice.... check the spelling of key reducers and not reducer
