..... in raect states are used to control the behavior of the application view.....

..... state changes are used to trigger change in the behavior of the view 

..... in bigger application with many components..... change of state in any component can be triggered from any other component.... so it brings the following PROBLEMS 

    1) state can get managed in multiple ways ?? 

    2) state gets updated from multiple places 

    3) difficult to trach the origin which triggered the state change: it'll be difficult in a multi component app to find the origin component which made a state change in another component 

    4) polluting of state: with no tracking there might be chances that the developer pollute the state by using fixing codes 

    5) no predictibility: the above all contribute to unpredictable nature of state changes in the application 


    ** the solution for all the above problems is to use STATE MANAGEMENT TOOLS.... ONE of the popular state management tool is REDUX


- what is REDUX? 

    - REDUX is an ARCHETECTURAL CONCEPT to manage states PREDICTABILY
