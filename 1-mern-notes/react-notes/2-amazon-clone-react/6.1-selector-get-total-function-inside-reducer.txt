now we need to dynamically add total price inside subtotal component.....

.... we tried to add a function inside the subtotal component to find the total price.... but it didn't work..... 

**** it's a software standard that it's better to write functions related to a component inside REDUCER as SELECTOR....

- goto reducer.js..... write an arrow function to find total price using array method reduce....

- goto subtotal.js component:
    - import get total function from reducer
    - inside the currency context value variable..... call the total amount function from the reducer

- now we can see dynamically changing amount inside the checkout page (inside subtotal component)

***** don't put curly {} for arrow function made for total amount in reducer.js.... else total amount won't ger displayed dynamically inside the subtotal component....
