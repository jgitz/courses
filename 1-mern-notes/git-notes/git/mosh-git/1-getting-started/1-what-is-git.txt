    - it stores all the changes made in our files in a database called repository.

    - we can see all our history of file changes and revert back to older state if needed.

what is version control system : it is a system where we can track update history of our files and enables many developers to work on the same projece

what are types of version control systems
    - there are two types 1) centralised vcs 2) distributed vcs

        1) centralised vcs : all developers connect to a central server.

        eg: subversion, tfs (team foundation server).
            - demerit: if central server goes offline, whole team cannot collaborate anymore.


        2) distributed vcs : here every team members has copy of the  project files locally so they can synchronise by sharing files between them

        eg: git, mercurial
