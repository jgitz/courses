certain log files and binary files should not be added to git, as it will increase the size of our files in git repo..... so we should ignore these file

- to prevent a folder/files from tracking
    - goto the folder where you want to ignore certain files

        - create a new file named .gitignore

        - open the .gitignore file and add files and folders which you want to ignore in the following format

            - for folders: <folder name>/
            - for files: <file name with extension>
            - for pattern: eg:  *.txt

            - save the file

    ***** .gitignore won't work for a file if the file was earlied COMMITTED.... so we have to remove it exclusively from the staging area and then commit one more time.... so to make .gitignore work for a folder/file that was earlier committed..... do as follows....
        
        - remove the file/ folder from staging area
            - :: git rm --cached -r <folder/> 
                    ** / after the folder name is important

                    ** to remove a file from staging area EXCLUDE -r option

            - :: git commit -m "message" 

            **** now the file/folder is ignored if it is added inside .gitignore file
