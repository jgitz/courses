- FIND METHOD: is a method that can be chained to MODEL CLASS to retrieve all documents from the collection 

    ** SYNTAX:

        const <data> = await <Model_variable>.find()


            ** find method returns a promise... hence AWAIT is used.... so this line should be WRAPPED inside an ASYNC FUNCTION 

            ** more methods can be chained to the result such as 

                - limit method: to set maximum number of documents to display 

                    limit(<number of documents>)

                - skip method: to skip n number of documents and display the rest 

                    skip(<number of documents>)

                - sort: to sort the result in ascending or descending 

                    sort({<field>: <1 or -1>})

                        ** 1 to sort in ascending order 

                        ** -1 to sort in descending order

                - select: to select the only fields you want to display as output from the documents 

                    select({<field>: <1 or 0>, <field>: <1 or 0>})

                        ** 1 to display the field and value 

                        ** 0 to omit the field and value 

                        **** by default _id field will always be displayed automatically.... unless we explicitely set _id: 0 inside the select object
