.... there are two approaches to delete objects 

1) using deleteOne or deleteMany METHODS inside async function 

    const <data> = await <Model_variable>.deleteOne({_id: "<id value>"})

        ** returned promised data is the number of deleted documents (more than 1 if deleteMany method is used)

2) using findByIdAndRemove method inside async function ....

      const <data> = await <Model_variable>
                      .findByIdAndRemove("id")

          ** the return value of the promise is the DELETED DOCUMENT 

          ** if the document with the id is absent.... the promise will return NULL value
