- Testing: is a process of testing your application before deployment..... testing can be  

      1) manual: manually testing the application

      2) automated: testing application by writing test code. 

            ** automated testing is further classified into 

                1) UNIT TESTING: testing a unit or block of code in an application without its external dependencies.

                    - cheap to write 
                    - executes fast

                2) INTEGRATED TESTING: tests the application code with its external dependencies

                    - tests the application with its external dependencies 

                    - takes long time to execute 

                3) END TO END TESTING: drives an application through its UI using specific tools like SELENIUM.. 

                    - very slow 

                    - small change in the application can break this test
