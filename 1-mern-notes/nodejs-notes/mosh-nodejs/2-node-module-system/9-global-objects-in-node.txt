- node includes many functions and methods that can be used in both browser as well as in server.

- global objects and functions are those which can be accessed from any file in the server.


- browser specific global objects that works in node

    - setTimeout()
    - clearTimeout()

    - setInterval()
    - clearInterval()

    - the above functions are part of WINDOW object inside a browser.... but inside node, these are part of object named GLOBAL object... so the above functions can be written as

      - global.setTimeout()
      - global.clearTimeout()
      - global.setInterval()
      - global.clearInterval()

    - console.log()

    - more node global functions later


- scope of a variable created in node is scoped to that file and is not global
