..... we cannot hard code a port number since site will be hosted by a hosting company

..... so we need to store the port in an environment variable outside the application

..... usuall environment variable is set with these steps

  - open cli.... and type the following command to set an environment variable in your device

    :: set PORT=5000

      ** for mac

          :: set PORT=5000

    

  - to use the PORT environment variable 
  const port = process.env.<PORT> || <3000>

    ** means if environment variable named PORT is NOT found.... the app use port 3000
