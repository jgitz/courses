- nested function: means functions defined inside another function block.

    - main function is called parent function

    - inner function is called the child function


- LEXICAL scope: scope inside a nested function

    - when a nested function is invoked:

        - first the inner function searches variables its own function scope.

        - then the inner function searches variables inside the parent scope.

        - then the inner function searches for variables inside the global scope.

        ** child function can access the parent function variables.

        ** parent function CANNOT access the child function variables.
