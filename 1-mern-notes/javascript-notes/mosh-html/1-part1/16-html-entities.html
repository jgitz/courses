<!-- 

.... symbols or special characters like < > cannot be displayed in an html page... 

.... to display it we use HTML ENTITIES 

- HTML ENTITIES: 

    - syntax: always starts with & and ends with ;... entity code is written between & and ;

- commoon html entities codes 

      - < : &lt;
      - > : &gt;
      - copyright: &copy;

      ** sometimes when big sentences are rendered... some words that should be stick together as one would break into other line due to auto adjustment... to prevent that 

        - use non breaking space html entity &nbsp; between the words you want to stick together
