/* 

- relational css selectors: are used to select elements based on reference of other elements 

***** relational selectors has the following problems 

    - not fast as basic selectors 

    - fragile because moving position of elements affects the css 

** only use relational selectors if the html code is no going to change..... else use basic id and class selectors

*/

 parent child {} /* descendant selector: selects ALL the child elements of the parent */

 parent > child {} /* immediate child selector: selects ONLY the next immediate child element of the parent */

 element + sibling {} /* immediate sibling selector: selects ONLY the NEXT IMMEDIATE SIBLING  */

 element ~ sibling {} /* all sibling selector: selects ALL the siblings of the element */

 p.class_name {} /* selects every p tags with class name named class_name

      ** not preferred as it is not flexible
    
    */

 parent .class_name {} /* selects EVERY child with class name namee class_name */
