.... in our design there are many variations of icons.... i.e icons with different colors and background colors

.... in this project.... icons files are provided in resources in SVG HTML FILES.... i.e the icon designs are designed using XML in svg form 

- step 1: create an svg sprite of all icon svg files EXCEPT attributes.txt and logo.svg 

  - use this site to generate svg sprite: https://svgsprit.es/

  - download the svg sprite and paste it inside project/images folder 

  ** the sprite file contains the following XML TAGS 

    - svg: to design svg designs 

    - symbol: each symbol tag is an icon 

    - path: each path value defines the curves of the icon.... this defines the icon design

- step 2: to USE/DISPLAY sprite file ICONS in INDEX.HTML use the following codes inside index.html body

  <svg class="icon">
    <use xlink:href="<path of sprite file>#<symbol id>"></use>
  <svg/>

    ** svg is a xml wrapper to use svg tags 

    ** use tag is used to use sprite/svg file located in another folder location

    ** xlink:href is an attribute to point to our required icon in the sprite 

    ** #<symbol id> : is obtained from ID ATTRIBUTE of SYMBOL TAG of the SPRITE FILE 

      ** each icon is inside symbol attributes with distinct id's.... use the id of the required sprite icon

    **** NO NEED TO search these codes inside the sprite file.... instead at the VERY END of the SPRITE GENERATING WEBSITE.... these will be written.... COPY IT from there 

      ** after pasting.... CHANGE THE PATH to our SPRITE file location in xlink:href ATTRIBUTE

.... now our design has many icons with primary color and background color.... 

** WRAP each <svg></svg> icon inside SPAN with CLASS "icon-container".... then only we can give BACKGROUND COLOR to the ICON SVG'S 

** here svg tag class ICON is readymade from sprite website.... and use CLASS ICON the BLOCK of BEM 

** icon--primary is the MODIFIER of block ICON with color PRIMARY 

  ** fill: <color> : css is used to fill COLOR to an SVG DESIGN.... FILL attribute ONLY WORKS with SVG FILES/DESIGNS

    **** color: <color> WON'T work with svg tag.... so use fill

** adding CIRCLE BACKGROUND COLOR to icon 

    - use .icon-container to style this 

    - inside .icon-container selector

        - use background attribute to set the background color 

        - use appropriate SAME WIDTH and HEIGHT values to set container DIMENSION TO SQUARE.... here we used 64px as width and height 

        - use border-radius: 100%; to make the squre container to CIRCLE (as per the design the background of icon is a CIRCLE)
        
        - use display: inline-flex: because 

            - our container is a SPAN which is an INLINE element and inline element don't allow to set width and height property

            - flex because we need to CENTER the ICON inside the container

        - use flex container properties: to center the icon inside the container

            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
