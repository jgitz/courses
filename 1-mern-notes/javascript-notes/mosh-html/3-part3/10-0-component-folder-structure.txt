.... our website has many components.... so to DESIGN and VIEW the component we need to use SEPARATE HTML files .... and css file....

... but after designing we add the component css to STYLES.CSS 

- to implement this... we use a folder structure

  - step1: goto project folder 

      - create a folder named components 

  - step 2: got project/components folder 

      - create html file to design component 

      - create css file to design component 

          ** instead we can use EMBEDDED CSS in the html file using style tag

      - after designing... copy and paste the css to the styles.css
