.... consider the light blue card component with $14 plan.... it has the following components inside it 

    - plan name text 

    - plan cost text

    - a badge component of 10% off 

    - a list component with tick bullet points 

    - a block button of outline variation


** only first make SKELETON of the card component which has the following classes 

  ** BLOCK CLASS "card" for outer container 

      - should have rounded corners
      - should have box shadow

  ** ELEMENT CLASS "card__header" for hosting header details 

  ** ELEMENT CLASS "card__body" for hosting body details 

  ** MODIFIER CLASS "card--primary" for cards with header of primary color 
    
    - background color of primary color 
    - text color = white

  ** MODIFIER CLASS "card--secondary" for cards with hader of secondary color 

    - background color of secondary color 
    - text color = white

**** DON'T ADD height and width to CARD class.... let it stretch entirely and be flexible.... to make it viewable of a required dimension.... WRAP the CARD in ANOTHER DIV and give that div an INLINE DIMENSION (for testing)

**** overflow: hidden; when you add BACKGROUND color to an element with BORDER RADIUS... the border radius will DISAPPEAR.... to BRING BACK BORDER RADIUS... we add overflow: hidden; to the element... here it is given to CARD class

** add other components which are children of the card later
