<!-- 
  - GRID: is a utility in css that allows us to arrange items in BOTH X-AXIS and Y-AXIS
  
    ** mostly used to make photo collage and SITE LAYOUT with header, sidebar, content, and footer

  - display:grid; >> is the property used to enable grid in the CONTAINER 

  - MEASURING UNITS for grid structure

      - for fixed constant size (absolute size) use px unit 

      - use fr unit which takes space on % of available space....

      - auto: use auto for dynamic space when resizing screen

  - METHODS to construct GRID STRUCTURES 

      ...to build a GRID structure with 3 rows and 2 columns of 100px


        1) METHOD 1: 
        
            .container {
              grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);

              grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 100px)
            }

        2) METHOD 2: ** most preferred shorthand

            .container {
              grid-tmeplate: repeat(3, 100px) / repeat(2, 100px)
            }

        3) METHOD 3: demonstrating mixed use of units like px, fr and auto 

            .container {
              grid-template: 100px auto 100px / 30fr 70fr;
            }

  - PROPERTIES to add GAP between rows and column OF GRID STRUCTURE

      - METHOD 1: 

          .container {
            row-gap: 10px;
            column-gap: 20px;
          }

      - METHOD 2: ** shorthand .... for 10px row gap and 20 px column gap

          .container {
            gap : 10px 20px;
          }

  - PROPERTIES to position GRID ITEMS inside its indivisual CELL STRUCTURE

       ** these properties are applied to THE CONTAINER and not to the ITEMS


       - justify-items: to align items in the X-AXIS.... values 

          - stretch (DEFAULT): item fills entire width of the GRID CELL 

              ** ONLY happens if we've NOT set WIDTH of the item 


          - start  
          - end 
          - center

          ** items move RELATIVE to the respective CELL STRUCTURE
          
      - align-items: to align the items in the Y-AXIS.... values 

            - stretch (DEFAULT): item fills entire width of the GRID CELL 

              ** ONLY happens if we've NOT set HEIGHT of the item 

            - start 
            - end 
            - center

      
          ** items move RELATIVE to the respective CELL STRUCTURE

  - PROPERTIES to position GRID STRUCTURE... RELATIVE to the GRID CONTAINER borders

      ** the below properties are given to the CONTAINER and NOT to the ITEMS

      - justify-content: to position entire grid structure in X-axis with respect to the container.... values 
      
          - start 
          - end
          - center 

      - align-content: to position entire grid structure in Y-axis with respect to the container.... values 
      
          - start 
          - end
          - center 

  - GRID ITEM properties: these properties are assigned to the individual ITEMS and NOT the container

      ** these properties are used to MOVE AROUND the items in PREFERRED CELLS, skip cells, and span across multiple cells...

          **** EXCEPTION 4TH method when using NAMED GRID AREAS.... here we use both container and items

      ** each cell is identified by 2 ways 

          1) row or column number... 1, 2, 3 etc

          2) column and row lines 

              1 - means FIRST LINE 

              -1 - means LAST LINE

      ** different METHODS used are 

          1) to make 1st item to span across beginning and end of column lines
          
              .item-one {
                  grid-column: 1 / -1
              }

          2) to make the 1st item to span across 2 columns 

              .item-one {
                grid-column: 1 / span 2
              }

          3) to make the 1st item to move to the 2nd row and span 2 rows 

              .item-one {
                grid-row: 2 / span 2
              }

          4) **** PROCEDURE for using GRID AREA METHOD of moving around items

              - step 1:...INSIDE CONTAINERS set names to the cell using grid template areas

                  .container {
                    display: grid;
                    grid-template: 100px auto 100px / 30fr 70fr;

                    grid-template-areas: 
                    "header header"
                     "sidebar main" 
                     "footer footer";
                  }

                    ** here we are giving names of our choice to the individual CELLS of the GRID STRCTURE

                    ** if we want to omit a cell WITHOUT name.... leave a DOT (.)

              - step 2: moving around the items to the NAMED AREAS 

                  .item-one {
                    grid-column: 1/span 2
                    grid-area: header;
                  }

                    


                    **** no need for "" for grid-area value
