  - what are NODES? 

      - There is nothing like elements inside an html.... all that we see in a HTML page is a NODE..... what we call element/tag is in reality an ELEMENT NODE.... and this is one among many other types of node 

      - TYPES of NODES in an html page: there are 13?? different nodes in dom.... but most commonly used nodes are....

          1) ELEMENT NODE: every element/tag in form of <></> is an ELEMENT Node

          2) TEXT NODE: any text we write in html WITHOUT a <></> wrap is a text node 

            ** A space is also a text node

            ** also a TEXT NODE is created EVERYTIME we press ENTER key inside html document

          3) COMMENT NODE: any text wrapped in html comment syntax is a comment node

          4) DOCUMENT NODE: content of entire html file 

          5) DOCUMENT TYPE NODE: it has the content is the line <!DOCTYPE html>

            ** document type node is the FIRST CHILD of the DOCUMENT NODE 

          6) DOCUMENT FRAGMENT NODE: ??

              usage:
              
                  let <> = new DocumentFragment()

- ELEMENT: is technically ELEMENT NODE..... i.e anything of the form <></>

** every node can have child nodes.... fo eg 

    <h1>heading</h1>

      ** here h1 is an element node and is a PARENT 

      ** heading is a text node and is CHILD of h1 parent node

** TEXT NODES, COMMENT NODES, ELEMENT NODES be CHILD NODES 

** ONLY ELEMENT NODES can be a PARENT NODE

** to know node type of element use 

    <>.nodeType
    
      ** output values determine the node type 

        - 1 means ELEMENT NODE 
        - 3 means TEXT NODE 
        - 8 means COMMENT NODE
        - 9 means DOCUMENT NODE 
        - 10 means DOCUMENT TYPE NODE 
        - 11 means DOCUMENT FRAGMENT NODE

** to know the value of a child node inside a parent node ue 

    - <parent>.childNodes[0].nodeValue
