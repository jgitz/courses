    ** for all other installations use --save

- goto package.json file

    - inside scripts line...

        - delete the test line

        - add this line 

            "compile:sass": "node-sass <location of main.scss file> <location of style.css> -w"

              ** main.scss file is the file we write sass codes.... it should be created by the user

              ** style.css file is the file where compiled sass code is outputted as css codes
