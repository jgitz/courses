- ARRAYS and sets are used when you just want to create a SIMPLE LIST of VALUES

- WHEN to use ARRAYS?

    ** when you want an ORDERED list of values 

    ** when you want DUPLICATE values

    ** when you want to MANIPULATE values


- WHEN to use SET?

    ** when you want NON-REPETITIVE list of values

    ** when ORDER of the list DOES NOT matter

    ** when you want to REMOVE DUPLICATES from ARRAYS

    ** when HIGH PERFORMANCE is important (eg: deletion of elements if way more faster in SETS than in ARRAYS)
