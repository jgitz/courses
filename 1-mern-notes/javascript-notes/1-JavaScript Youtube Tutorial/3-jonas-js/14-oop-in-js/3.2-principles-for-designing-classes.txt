- there are 4 PRINCIPLES to be followed to design a GOOD CLASS 

    1) ABSTRACTION : hiding and ignoring irrelevant details and only expose an overview.

        ** most low level working of methods and functions in js is hidden

    2) ENCAPSULATION: method of keeping methods and properties of class PRIVATE, PREVENTING access/manipulation of it from OUTSIDE the class

        ** methods of a class can be exposed to outside elements of class using PUBLIC API's

        ** private keyword DON'T EXIST is js

    3) INHERITANCE: two similar functioning classes can be designed just by INHERITING properties from one class inside the other INSTEAD of COPYING the entire common properties....

        ** the class where PROPERTIES are SPECIFIED is known as PARENT CLASS 

        ** class which inherit properties from parent class is known as CHILD CLASS

        ** CHILD class can have ITS OWN unique properties too apart from inherited properties

        ** INHERITANCE helps in creating REUSABLE LOGICS

    4) POLYMORPHISM: concept where a CHILD class can OVERWRITE a METHOD it INHERITED from the PARENT class
