/* 

- for Each also works for looping MAP and SET data structure like that of arrays

    ** in maps there are 3 arguments for the call back function... 1) value 2) key 3) entire map

    ** in sets there are 3 arguments for the call back functions... 1) value 2) value 3) entire set

        ** the 2nd argument is same as first because set has no key or index number
