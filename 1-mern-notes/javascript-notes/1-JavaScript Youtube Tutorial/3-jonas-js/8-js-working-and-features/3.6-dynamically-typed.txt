- js is a DYNAMICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE 

- DYNAMICALLY TYPED: the variables are not assigned DATA type, the type AUTOMATICALLY get assigned when the js engine runs the code.

  ** type checking happens at the run time in js

  ** in c++ type checking happens at compilation. Hence it is STATICALLY TYPED....here we've to manually assign variables..
