- EXCEPT PRIMITIVE data types everything is an OBJECT 

- so an array is an object 

  - any array is created from a BLUEPRINT called ARRAY CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION....and this function has a property called PROTOTYPE
  - this array prototype holds array METHODS such as push pop etc 

  - any array created in the js inherits method from prototype
