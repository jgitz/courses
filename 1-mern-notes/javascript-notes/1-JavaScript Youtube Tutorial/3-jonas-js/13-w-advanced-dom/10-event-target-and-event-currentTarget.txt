.... so most of the events are accessable from the parent element even if it occured at a target element..... for eg

.... if we do a click on a target element.... that click can can be listned in the parent element as well..... but original place where the click occured is target element....

..... so 2 event methods can be used to find the distinguish the TARGET ELEMENT and THE CURRENT element (PARENT ELEMENT) when attaching event listner on a parent element 


- inside EVENT HANDLER FUNCTION use :

    <e>.target 

        ** to find the original element where the event occured 

- inside EVENT HANDLER FUNCTION use : 

    <e>.currentTarget 

        ** to find the parent element from which it is accessed 


- inside EVENT HANDLER FUNCTION at the TARGET or PARENT element use : 

    <e>.stopPropagation()

        ** to stop bubbling up of the events to the root document element 


**** it's BAD PRACTICE to use e.stopPropagation() unless it is necessary
