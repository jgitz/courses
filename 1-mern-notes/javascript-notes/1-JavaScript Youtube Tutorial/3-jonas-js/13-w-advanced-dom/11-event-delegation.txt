.... if you want to add event listners to many elements.... 

** DON't make add event listners to each element.... as that is INEFFICIENT for large scale application

** FIND a COMMON PARENT ELEMENT to all the TARGET ELEMENTS and add a SINGLE EVENT LISTNER THERE 

** inside the event listner handler....

      ** use e.target to manipulate original target element where the click happened 

      ** USE AN IF statement to track only event that is happened at the target element
