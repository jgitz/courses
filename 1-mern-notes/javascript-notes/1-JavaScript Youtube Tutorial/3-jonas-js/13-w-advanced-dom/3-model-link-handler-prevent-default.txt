..... in a website.... we mostly make all the clickable buttons as links...

.... so if we have a button which pops up a window of model on clicking it.... there will be a jump/ shift in the page.... that is a DEFAULT BEHAVIOR  of LINKS.... so 

      ** inside the click handler of the link..... use 

            e.preventDefault()
