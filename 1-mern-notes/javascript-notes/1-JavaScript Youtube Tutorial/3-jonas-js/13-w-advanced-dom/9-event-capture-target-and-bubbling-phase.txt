- when an event occurs in an element (TARGET ELEMENT) it undergoes 3 phase 

    1) CAPTURING PHASE: the event is created at DOCUMENT ELEMENT and then the event travels from document element through all the PARENT ELEMENTS of the target element.... and FINALLY to the TARGET ELEMENT 

    2) TARGET PHASE: once the event reaches the TARGET ELEMENT.... the event can be HANDLED using EVENT LISTENER

    3) BUBBLING PHASE: after reaching the target element.... the event then TRAVELS BACK to the DOCUMENT ELEMENT through ALL its PARENT ELEMENTS...

        ** so the event can be handled on PARENT ELEMENTS as well using event listner.


**** some events can be handled at parent elements at capturing phase also..

**** but NOT ALL events can be handled on PARENT ELEMENTS during capturing and bubbling phase

**** some events can ONLY BE handled at TARGET ELEMENT
