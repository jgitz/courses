** in js only DIRECT siblings can be accessed i.e previous sibling and the next sibling


- to get the previous sibling 

      <query_selector_variable>
      .previousElementSibling

- to get the next sibling 

      <query_selector_variable>
      .nextElementSibling

- to get all the siblings of an element (no direct method.... instead go to the direct parent and select the direct children)

      <query_selector_variable>
      .parentElement
      .children

          ** o/p: is an html collection with index number of sibling elements

          ** we can make an array using spread operator and use forEach to loop over and manipulate siblings if required
