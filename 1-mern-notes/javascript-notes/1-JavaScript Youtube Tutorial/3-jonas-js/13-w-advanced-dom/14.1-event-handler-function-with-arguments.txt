..... some times a event handler function written outside the event listner as a function would have arguments to be put in.....

.... but the putting the argument inside the by specifying the arguments inside the handler of event listner method like BELOW WON'T WORK 

    <query_selector_variable>
    .addEventListner("<event>", event_handler(argument1, argument2))


    **** this WON'T WORK

            ** solution is to PUT the arguments INSIDE BIND METHOD like this
            
                <query_selector_variable>
                .addEventListner("<event>", event_handler.bind(argument1, argument2))

                     **** the original handler functio should have only ONE ARGUMENT and that is e (event)....

                     **** any other argument passed through bind is accessed via THIS keyword 

                     ***** if multiple have to be passed.... pass it as an array in the bind () 


**** this is because the add event listner by its syntax ONLY ALLOWS handler function and NOT a function call 

**** bind method creates a copy of the function and enables to do actions on it
