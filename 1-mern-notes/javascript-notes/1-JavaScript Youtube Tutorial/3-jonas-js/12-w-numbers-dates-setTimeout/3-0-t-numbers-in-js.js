/* 

- NUMBERS IN JS 

    - numbers in js is always FLOATING POINT numbers in background.... i.e 

        - an integer 23 is stored as 23.0 in the background

    - in the background the numbers are stored as BINARY 

        - the problem with storing numbers as binary is that..... we cannot get precision fraction and decimal calculations.... hence.... JS is NOT used for SCIENTIFIC and FINANCIAL calculations

*/

console.log(23 === 23.0) // true ** integers in js is stored as FLOATS inside js
