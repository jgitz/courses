- HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION: is a PARENT FUNCTION inside which another FUNCTIONS are PASSED IN as ARGUMENTS or RETURNED 

- CALLBACK FUNCTION: is the FUNCTION that is PASSED in as an ARGUMENT into a FUNCTION


- EXAMPLE

    function PARENT(callback_function) {

    }

        ** here parent function is a HIGHER order function as it takes function as an argument 

        ** here CALLBACK_function is a CALL BACK function since it is passed as an argument into another function


- ADVANTAGES OF USE OF CALLBACKs and HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS 

    1) It breaks the code into REUSABLE functional units 

    2) It provides ABSTRACTIONS because a bigger task is done calling smaller function tasks
