- a closure gives function access to the variables of PARENT FUNCTION even AFTER EXECUTION of parent function 

- the variables that closure remembers includes function arguments 

** during VARIABLE LOOKUP.... CLOSURE is given MORE PRIORITY than other SCOPES

- variables are remembered by closure due to JS ENGINE mechanism

- variables remembered by closure cannot be manipulated.... but CAN BE SEEN using COMMAND

    console.dir(<function>)
