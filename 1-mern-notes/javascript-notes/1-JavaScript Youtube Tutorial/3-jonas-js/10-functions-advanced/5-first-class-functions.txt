- Why functions are called FIRST CLASS CITIZENS?

  because

      ** everything in js is an OBJECT including FUNCTIONS and has methods to do operations

      ** so since function is an object.... it is treated as a VALUE that can be done anything

      ** so FUNCTION can be 

          ** stored in a VARIABLE

          ** used as argument inside a function

          ** used as return value from a function
