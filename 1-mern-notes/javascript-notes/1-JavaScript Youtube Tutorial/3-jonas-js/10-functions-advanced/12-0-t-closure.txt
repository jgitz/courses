- CLOSURE: is a background process in js by which the variables of an EXECUTED function PERSISTS in the MEMORY even after its execution.

  ** closures happens automatically in background whenever a function is created 

  ** closure persists both VARIABLES and ARGUMENTS defined inside a function 

  ** in SCOPE LOOK UP.... the CLOSURE VARIABLE ENVIRONMENT has MORE preference than GLOBAL SCOPE VARIABLE

**** you DON'T need a function to be RETURNED from inside of ANOTHER FUNCTION to see WORKING of scope chain (examples in next notes)
