  .... in 2017 there was a SYNTAX update to CONSUME PROMISE in another way inseted of .then and .catch....

  .... this method uses ASYNC and AWAIT keywords 

  - ASYNC FUNCTION keyword: is just a keyword to CONVERT a function into an ASYNCHRONOUS function.... when the js intercepts it.... this is then DIRECTLY send to WEB API BLOCK.... 

      ** syntax 

            async function <function name> () {
              async codes here like fetch api methods
            }

      ** ASYNC function always treats ITS RETURN VALUE as a PROMISE.... so to obtain the return value of an async function... either 

            - chain a .then to the async funtion (not recommended because now async await is mixed with .then)... or 

            - make an async IIFE and use the async function and store its return value INSIDE an AWAIT keyword like this (later lecture )

            **** if any of the above two methods is NOT used.... the async function will AUTOMATICALLY return the LAST AWAIT variable value

  - AWAIT KEYWORD: is a keyword that makes some ASYNCRONOUS code to wait till its final result....

      ** syntax 

          const response =  await fetch("endpoint url")

      ***** await codes can ONLY RESIDE inside an ASYNC keyword function

      ***** anlways CALL/INVOKE the ASYNC keyword function to run the await codes written inside it

      ** await is similar to .then method keyword 

      ** advantage is that await allows to store the RESPONSE inside a VARIABLE.... and unlike .THEN .... await DON'T need another callback to do that 

      ** to mirror the use of MULTIPLE CHAINING of .then.... MULTIPLE AWAITS ARE USED.... for eg 

            - we used to chain .then to first recieve response object and convert it to json OBJECT using .json() method

            - then we used to chain ANOTHER .then to display the json object in the console

            ** to mirror this using ASYNC AWAIT..... we use MULTIPLE AWAITS for EACH .THEN.... LIKE this 


                async function <function name> {
                  const response = await fetch("<endpoint url>")  

                  const data = await response.json()

                  console.log(data)
                }

            ** ALWAYS INVOKE/CALL the ASYNC function which holds the await codes... inorder to execute it

** ERROR handling is achieved using TRY and CATCH block inside the async function.... (next file)

**** ASYNC AWAIT are just syntactic sugar.... actually .then and .catch works in background
