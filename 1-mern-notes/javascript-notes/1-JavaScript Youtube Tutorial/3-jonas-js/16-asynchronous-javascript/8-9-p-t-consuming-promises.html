<!-- 
  - CONSUMING PROMISE: a promise RESPONSE is returned by the SERVER..... the process of EXTRACTING data from the response by the CLIENT is known as consuming promise 

  ** promise response is consumed using .THEN method

  ** error in promise return is handled by .CATCH method

    ** it takes a callback with an ERROR argument.....

    ** ERROR argument uses throw new Error() constructor IN THE BACKGROUND..... hence we can use <error argument>.message to display ACTUAL ERROR MESSAGE 

    ** CONVENTION is to use CONSOLE.LOG("<ERROR MESSAGE>") to log the error in the console

  ** .FINALLY is CHAINED inorder to run some code EVEN if the PROMISE is FULFILLED or REJECTED.... it has a CALLBACK FUNCTION as an argument to write the codes in it

    ** common use case is to stop running loading spinner css when there is error or when the page is loaded

  ** in FETCH API....if the response is in JSON..... we need to convert it to OBJECT using .json()..... and to extract data we need to CHAIN ANOTHER .then to it..... because.... .json() returns a PROMISE

- FETCH API promise response: the response from fetch api will be an OBJECT with status code, headers, and body.... and BODY item of the object contains the JSON STRING.... .json() method is to extract that and convert it to js OBJECT

    ** .json() method is used because NOT all API ENDPOINTS allow you to read data from its BODY of the respone OBJECT
 -->

<!-- practice

 - use this endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts using FETCH API 

    - fetch the response json data 

    - convert it to js OBJECT usin .json() method

    - display it in the console
