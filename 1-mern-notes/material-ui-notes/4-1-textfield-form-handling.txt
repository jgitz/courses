..... in this session we learn how to handle the inputs to text fields inside a form


** there is NO form tag from MUI.... we use traditional html form tag with onSubmit attribute 

** form should have a submit button with type submit and an onClick attribute set to a HANDLER FUNCTION 

** textfield mui component should have the following attributes 

    - name attribute : enables to use a single onchange handler on multiple text fields with use of [e.target.name] as key ([] is used to set dynamic/computed values as key) in onchange handler function

    - value: to set initial value... usually it is pointed to a state variable

    - onchange attribute set to handler function 

    - type: text, number, email, password etc 

    - label: display name for text field.... doubles as placeholder too
