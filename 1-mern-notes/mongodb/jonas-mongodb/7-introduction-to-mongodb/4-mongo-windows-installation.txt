- now to use mongo commands we need to install mongo shell application known as MONGOSH 

    - goto https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

        - download msi installer (not zip) 

        - before installation always copy/remember the installation path.... IT IS NEEDED TO SET ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABEL

        - install 

- setting environmental variable such that MONGOSH.EXE shell can be run from anywhere 

    - search for environmental variables in windows search 

    - under user variables.... select path...

        - click new and add the mongosh installation folder path


** now to open mongosh from anywhere... inside cli type 

    :: mongosh.exe ::

         ** now we can use mongodb commands to manipulate data in mongodb server
