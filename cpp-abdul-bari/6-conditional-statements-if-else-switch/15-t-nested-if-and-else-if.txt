- nested if : if as well as else blocks can accomodate more if and else statements inside 

- else if: 

    - syntax: 

        if (<condtion>) {
          codes
        } else if (<condition>) {
          codes
        } else {
          codes
        }

          ** else if is a syntax which avoids congestion of nested if and else inside if and else blocks 

          ** ELSE IF LADDER: is usage of multiple else if..... between first if statement and last else statement
