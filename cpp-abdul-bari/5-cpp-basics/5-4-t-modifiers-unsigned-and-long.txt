- MODIFIERS: are keywords used to extend the range and size of certain datatypes for various requirements 

- 2 most commonly used modifiers are 

    1) UNSIGNED: 

        - can only be used with INT and CHAR 

        - unsigned int: 

            - the -ve range of int is converted to +ve range.... hence an unsigned int can store double the positive values with no -ve value 

            - RANGE: 0 to 65535 (for 2 byte int)

        - unsigned char: 

            - the -ve range of char is converted to +ve range.... hence an unsigned int can store double the positive values with no -ve value 

            - 0 - 255
  
    2) LONG: 

        - can only be used with INT and DOUBLE to extend the SIZE of the datatypes 

        - long int: 

            - size: 4 or 8 bytes 

        - long double:

            - size: 10 bytes
