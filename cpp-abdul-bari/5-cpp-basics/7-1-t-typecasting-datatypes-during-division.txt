... DIVISION between 2 INTEGER will give you only an INTEGER.... even if the quotient  is a float..... even if the variable where we store the value is float.... so to get the answer of 2 integer division as a float.. we employ TYPECASTING like this 

    int a, b;

    c = (float) a/b; 


** any variable can be typecasted to another by specifying the datatype inside ()

** TYPECASTING: is the process of converting a datatype into another
