- in C++ variable should be declared first with their datatype before using it like this 

    :: int RollNo;

- variable can also be declared and assigned an initial value in a single line like this 

    :: int RollNo = 0;

- CHAR variable values should be enclosed in SINGLE QUOTES... for eg

    :: char name = 'Teddy'

- it is a GOOD PRACTICE to add an "f" at the end of a float point value during assigning.... because else the compiler will assume the float to be double 

    :: float price = 8.88f 

- VARIABLE naming convention:

    - variable name SHOULD NOT start with a number 

    - variable name SHOULD NOT have space between the characters 

    - it is best practice to use PASCAL TYPE ( eg: RollNo) in c++ to name variables with multiple words 

    - give meaningful names are variable names.... eg price, RollNO... etcv
