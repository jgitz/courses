- different operators used in c++ are 

    1) ARITHEMATIC operators: 
        - +: addition
        - -: subtraction
        - *: multiplication
        - /: division
        - %: mod 

            ** mod operator can be used with only CHAR and INT 

            ** mod operator CANNOT be used with float 

    2) RELATIONAL operators: >, <, <=, >=, ==

    3) LOGICAL operators: &&, ||, !

        ** used with boolean expressions to get boolean outputs 

        ** mainly used for shortcircuiting

    4) BITWISE operators: 

        - &: and 

        - |: or 

        - ~: NOT 

        - ^: XOR : EXCLUSIVE OR only shows output 1 when both inputs are DIFFERENT i.e the input should be 0 and 1 to display output as 1.... if both the inputs are SAME, then the output is 0

        - << : left shift : means shifting places of a value by "i" bits to the left.... this is equivalent to 

            if x << i (means value of x is shifted by i places to the left), then the result is 

              x * 2^i

        - >> : right shift : means shifting places of a value by "i" bits to the right.... this is equivalent to....

            if x >> i (means value of x is shifted by i places to the right)....then the result is 

              x / (2^i)

        ** mainly used with INTEGERS to do BIT LEVEL OPERATIONS and OUTPUTS INTEGERS

    5) INCREMENT/DECREMENT operators : 

        - <variable>++ : post increment
        - <variable>-- : post decrement 
        - ++<variable> : pre increment 
        - --<variable> : post decrement 

          ** pre and post does the same thing when operator is used alone in a variable... but the behavior changes for pre and post operators when in an expression where more than 2 operators comes into play

          ** refer video 22 of this folder

    6) ASSIGNMENT operator: = 

    7) COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:

        - +=
        - -=
        - *=
        - /=
        - %= 

        - &=
        - |=
        - <<=
        - >>=
