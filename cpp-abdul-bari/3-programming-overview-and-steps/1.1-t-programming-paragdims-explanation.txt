- what is a programming paradigm?

    - it is the style of organising source code.

- the major programing paradigms are 

    1) Monolithic programming: every source code is written inside a single file with repeating codes 

        - both data and instructions are written in the same file on multiple lines

        - older style of programming 

        - eg BASIC programming language

    2) Modular/Procedural programming: 

          - repetitive codes are grouped together to form functions and these functions are called when needed

          - data needed are stored inside structure block 

          - repetitive codes are divided into multiple functions 

          - and functions and data structure are called inside the MAIN funciton 

    3) Objected oriented programming: 

          - here data and function needed for a specific operation is grouped into a class 

          - then inside the main function.... an object from the class is made.... this object is used to invoke the functions....
