- there are 4 types of LOOP/ITERATIVE statements used in c++

      1) WHILE LOOP: 

          - SYNTAX: 

                while(<condition>) {
                  codes
                }

      2) DO WHILE LOOP: 

          - SYNTAX: 

              do {
                codes 
              }

              while (<condition>);

                ** the difference between while and do while is that.... do while loop executes one time even if the condition is FALSE.

                ** while using a counter variable.... if NO UPDATION of counter variable value is done.... then the loop will become INFINITE loop

                ***** DON'T forget to put ; after while condition in DO WHILE LOOP

        3) FOR LOOP: 

            - SYNTAX: 

                for (<counter initialisation>; <condition>; <counter updation>) {
                  codes 
                }

                  ** used when we know the number of counts we want to execute the loop 

                  ** most commonly used loop in programming 

                  ** more readable than while loop

                  ** INFINITE LOOP: if NO UPDATION of counter variable is done... then the for loop will become INFINITE LOOP 

        4) FOR EACH LOOP: used for array elements iteration
