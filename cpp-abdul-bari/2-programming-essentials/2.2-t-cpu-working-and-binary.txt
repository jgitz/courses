- BINARY NUMBER & CPU: 

    - binary numbers has only 2 states 0 and 1

    - cpu can only take instructions in form of binary numbers.... cpu takes 0's and 1's in the form on LOW LEVEL and HIGH LEVEL voltages....

    - 1 BIT can hold a 0 or 1

    - 8 bits form 1 byte 

    - CPU takes instruction of length 8 BIT or 1 byte.... i.e an instruction is of size 8 BIT or 1 BYTE 

    - an 8 BIT can convey 2^8 combinations of different instructions..... i.e a cpu can take 256 different instructions....

    - program files inside main memory has lines of instructions with 8 bit sizes/line.... cpu executes each instruction line by line

    - the instruction combination for arithematic and logical operation is already pre coded into the cpu
