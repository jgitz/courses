- a computer has the following parts 

    1) CPU (eg i3, i5, i7 processors):
    
    - cpu has 2 parts 

        - ALU (Arithematic and Logical Unit): used to do arithematic operations such as addition, subtraction etc.... and logical operations such as .... greater than, less than, equal to, AND, OR and NOT

        - CU (Control Unit: coordinate and control resources such as main memory, i/p devices, o/p device

    - cpu is CONNECTED to MAIN MEMORY

        
        
    2) Hard disk: contains files.... 

          - FILES are of TWO TYPES

              1) PROGRAM FILES: eg: notepad.exe is a program file

              2) DATA FILES: stores data generated by program files... eg: notepad generate .txt files.... and .txt file is called data files

          - hard disk is a PERMANENT STORAGE

          - hard disk is LARGER in size

    3) Main Memory (Primary Memory): 

        - it is the memory connected to the cpu 

        - program files to be executed is brought into the main memory.... and CPU executes it LINE BY LINE....


    4) i/p devices: to give data input into the program files

        - Input buffer: is the memory belonging to the input device..... the input fed in is stored here... and programs read it from here

    5) o/p devices: output the data generated by the program and enable user to interact with the generated the output

        - Output buffer: is the memory belonging to the output device.... the generated output by the output device is stored here.
