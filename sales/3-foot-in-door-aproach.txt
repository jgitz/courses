- don't immediately try to make a sale 

- first build trust for some time with the customer and then push for the sale  

- don't ask for too many commitment on the first instance... ask for small commitments like 
  - hey when can we meet 
  - can we have a call for a minute 
  - talk only one topic on a call

- i.e put foot in a closing door and then start pushing the door to open
