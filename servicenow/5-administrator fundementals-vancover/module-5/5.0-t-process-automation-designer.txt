- PROCESS AUTOMATION DESIGNER (PAD): enables OWNERS to author CROSS-ENTERPRISE WORKFLOWS and create SINGLE UNIFIED PROCESS 

  ** PAD is used to AUTOMATE existing SERVICENOW PLATFORM CAPABILITIES such as SEND NOTIFICATIONS, CREATE NEW RECORDS, SUBMIT APPROVALS etc 

  ** it can be ALSO used to provide END-USERS with a SIMPLIFIED TASK-ORIENTED VIEW of your PROCESS

  ** PAD is used by CITIZEN DEVELOPERS and PROCESS OWNERS 

  ** to use PAD... goto ALL > PROCESS AUTOMATION > PROCESS DESIGNER 

  - STEPS in PROCESS AUTOMATION 

    1) CREATE PROCESS DEFINITION with TRIGGERS, LANES and ACTIVITIES 

    2) ACTIVATE PROCESS DEFINITION: this step will TRIGGER multiple AREAS/COMPONENTS of your system 

    3) PROCESS EXECUTION: your s/m will create PROCESS EXECUTION??

  ** an IDEAL PROCESS CONTAINS the following things:

    - trigger AUTOMATICALLY the RECORDS the END-USER wants  

    - REUSE ACTIVITIES from EXISTING FLOW DESIGNER content 

    - has WELL-DEFINED LANES that END USERS can FOLLOW for a RECORD 

    - clearly show NEXT STEPS that END USERS must take to move through a RECORD LIFECYCLE 


- BENEFITS of PAD 

  - connect WORKFLOWS and ACTIONS into an END-TO-END WORKFLOW?? 

  - REUSE existing FLOW DESIGNER FLOWS/ACTIONS/SUBFLOWS 

  - provide TASKBOARD INTERFACE to organize PROCESS ACTIVITIES 

  - GUIDE END-USERS to complete a process using interfaces such as PLAYBOOK (..task-oriented interface)

  - define consistent RECORD LIFECYCLE 

  - pass DATA b/w ACTIVITIES and STAGES?? 

  - specify CONDITIONS and ORDER in which ACTIVITIES and STAGES RUN
