.... BEFORE creating KNOWLEDGE ARTICLES.... one should configure and SET UP KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT in your instance.... 

... setting up knowledge management can be done in TWO WAYS 

  1) USING KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT GUIDED SETUP:

    - to view it... goto ALL > KNOWLEDGE > ADMINISTRATION > GUIDED SETUP  

    - the setup has DESCRIPTIONS, TASKS and INFORMATION on PLUGINS needed to setup KNOWLEDGE BASES 


  2) setting up KNOWLEDGE BASES WITHOUT GUIDED SETUP
