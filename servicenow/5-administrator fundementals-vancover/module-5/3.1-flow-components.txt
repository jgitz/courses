- FLOW COMPONENTS: a flow has six COMPONENTS 

  1) TRIGGERS: are ACITVITIES that INITIATE the flow 

    - TYPES of TRIGGERS 

      1.1) RECORD BASED TRIGGER : triggers flow when record is CREATED/UPDATED/DELETED

        - RECORD TRIGGER TYPES

          - CREATED 

          - UPDATED 

          - CREATED or UPDATED

      1.2) DATE BASED TRIGGER/SCHEDULED TRIGGER: trigger flow based on DATE and TIME... eg: daily, weekly, monthly...etc 

        - SCHEDULED TRIGGER TYPES

          - RUN ONCE 

          - DAILY 

          - WEEKLY 

          - MONTHLY 

          - REPEAT



        ** EXECUTION TIME?? can also be used as INPUT for ACTIONS in a flow 

      1.3) APPLICATION BASED TRIGGER: eg inbound email, service catalog, SLA TASK

        - APPLICATION TRIGGER TYPES
          
          - INBOUND EMAIL 

          - SLA TASK 

          - SERVICE CATALOG

          - application triggers can also be SPOKE SPECIFIC based on the installed SPOKE 

  2) CONDITIONS: are APPLIED to TRIGGERS.... and it determine WHEN or HOW an ACTION should RUN....eg run an action only if a field has a certain value 

  3) ACTIONS: are OPERATIONS EXECUTED by the s/m such as record look up, udpdate field value, request approval etc  

    - TYPES of ACTIONS

      3.1) APPLICATION SPECIFIC actions defined by SPOKES installed 

      3.2) SERVICENOW CORE ACTIONS: some of core actions are 

        - ASK FOR APPROVAL: create RULES FOR an APPROVAL/REJECTION/CANCELLATION/DUE DATE on any RECORD 

        - WAIT FOR CONDITION: PAUSE the flow untill a CONDITION is MET 

        - LOOK UP RECORD:  look up a SINGLE RECORD on ANY TABLE to confirm WHETHER it EXISTS or NOT 

        - CREATE RECORD

        - DELETE RECORD 

  4) FLOW LOGIC: is LOGIC used to DEFINE RELATIONSHIP b/w NODES

  
    - TYPES of FLOW LOGICS in FLOW DESIGNER 

      - CALL A WORKFLOW 

      - SET flow VARIABLES 

      - IF 

      - ELSE IF 

      - FOR EACH 

      - GET flow OUTPUT

      - END FLOW 

      - WAIT for a DURAITON of TIME 

      - DO the FOLLOWING in PARALLEL 

      - DYNAMIC FLOWS 

  5) DATA: data that can be used inside flow COMPONENTS

    - in flow designer we use DATA PANE (RIGHT) where we can see DATA PIILLS or USE DATA PILL PICKER 

  6) SUBFLOW: ??

** RUN AS field in flow is used to specify WHETHER to run the flow as a SYSTEM USER OR USER WHO THE INITIATE SESSION 

  - SYSTEM USER: means a SNOW ACCOUNT that is NOT RESTRICTED by ACCESS CONTROLS 

  - USER WHO INITIATES THE SESSION: means to run the flow as UPDATES comes form USER WHO TRIGGERS the flow 

** you can TEST the FLOW by clicking TEST BUTTON on top 

** to make the flow ACTIVE in the s/m... click ACTIVATE BUTTON on the top 


** SPOKE: contains FLOW DESIGNER TRIGGERS and ACTIONS dedicated to a SPECIFIC APPLICATION.... eg: ITSM SPOKE
