... there are FIVE MAJOR COMPONENTS that forms a SERVICE CATALOG 

  1) ITEM/CATALOG ITEM: are BUILDING BLOCK of SC... item can include 

    - SOFTWARE 
    - HARDWARE 
    - SERVICES 

    ** SC is used to ORDER ITEMS 

  2) RECORD PRODUCER: is a FRONT END FORM INTERFACE through which a SEPARATE TASK RECORD (** records can be created in ANY TABLE) can be created in the instance by a CUSTOMER 

    - eg incident management can use RECORD PRODUCER for users to OPEN an INCIDENT via WEB 

    ** RECORD PROCUCES produces a TASK BASED RECORD and NOT a REQUEST ITEM 

    ** you can create record producers for TABLES and DATABASE VIEWS?? 

    **** DONOT CREATE a REQUESTED ITEM RECORD using RECORD PRODUCER... requested item record is created using CATALOG ITEMS 

  3) VARIABLE: allows VARIANTS of an ITEM can be shown as QUESTIONS in the front end and customers can choose OPTIONS related to CATALOG ITEM.

    - COMMONLY USED VARIABLE TYPES ARE: 

      - REFERENCE
      - MULTIPLE CHOICE (RADIO BUTTONS)
      - SINGLE LINE TEXT 
      - SELECT BOXES (DROP DOWN)
      - CHECK BOXES 

      

    ** to view all VARIABLE RECORDS 

      - ALL > SERVICE CATALOG > CATALOG VARIABLES > ALL VARIABLES


    ** variables are GLOBAL by DEFAULT 

    ** a single variable can be USED in MULTIPLE PLACES 

  4) VARIABLE SET: is a COLLECTION OF VARIABLES that can be SHARED b/w CATALOG ITEMS.... so an admin DON'T REQUIRE to make VARIABLES separately for a SIMILAR CATALOG ITEMS 

    - to view all VARIABLE SET of your SC 

      - ALL > SERVICE CATALOG > CATALOG VARIABLES > VARIABLE SETS 

  5) FLOWS: it is where the admin can define REQUEST FULFILLMENT PROCESS for a catalog item 

    - flows allow you to SEND NOTIFICATIONSS to users and groups 

    ** FLOW is made using FLOW DESIGNER 

    - SIX DIFFERENT different FLOW STAGES are 

      1) WAITING FOR APPROVAL (IN PROGRESS)
      2) APPROVED 
      3) PENDING (has not started)
      4) FULFILLMENT (IN PROGRESS)
      5) DEPLOYMENT/DELIVERY 
      6) COMPLETED 

      ** each flow stage can have MULTIPLE APPROVAL ACTIONS 

      ** each stage can be grouped to STAGE SET if there are sub stages related to a stage 

** SC ITEM VARIABLES are available to be used in FILTERS, LIST LAYOUTS and REPORTS 


______________________________________________________

** ORDER GUIDE: you can create an order guide by ADDING MULTIPLE CATALOG ITEMS into it such that ESSENTIAL ITEMS NEEDED of a SPECIFIC USAGE CAN BE GROUPED TOGETHER and CAN BE ORDERED TOGETHER 

  - ORDER GUIDE enables to ORDER MULTIPLE RELATED ITEMS in ONE REQUEST 

  - ORDER GUIDE also helps to ASSIST USERS in DETERMINING ITEMS they need
