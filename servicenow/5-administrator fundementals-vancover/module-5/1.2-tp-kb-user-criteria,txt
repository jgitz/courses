..... not all users should be allowed access to the KB's.... for eg: HR related KB should ONLY be visible to HR users....

- USER CRITERIA: is the MODULE used to set SECURITY to KB'S

  - the user criteria allows you to give access to KB for a GROUP OF USERS, ROLES, users etc 

  ** USER CRITERIA is applied at KNOWLEDGE BASE LEVEL 

  - if a KB has NO USER in USER CRITERIA... the articles of that KB is accessible to ALL USERS 

  - USER CRITERIA RECORD: is a record where we give the USERS/GROUPS/ROLES to access a KB.... it can be created in the path 

    - ALL > KNOWLEDGE > ADMINISTRATION > USER CRITERIA 

    ** KB SPECIFIC user criteria records can be opened from the CAN READ, CAN CONTRIBUTE RELATED LIST TABS in KB RECORD 

    ***** MATCH ALL CHECKBOX: if checked.... all conditions (..fields??) of user criteria record SHOULD MATCH for access to kb.... if FALSE...matching only ONE CONDITION (..field??) of the record will grant access to KB  

  ***** we must ADD USER CRITERIA RECORD to KNOWLEDGE BASE RECORD to give ACCESS a knowledge base 

- KB ACCESS SETTINGS: there are FOUR access settings in a KNOWLEDGE BASE RECORD....to control user access to a KB 

  1) CAN READ: users/groups that can READ knowledge articles

  2) CAN CONTRIBUTE: users/groups can READ, CRAETE and MODIFY articles 

  3) CANNOT READ: users/groups that is NOT GIVEN READ ACCESS to ARTICLES

  4) CANNOT CONTRIBUTE: users/groups CAN READ.... BUT... CAN'T CREATE or MODIFY articles 

  ***** these are FOUR RELATED LIST TABS in a KB RECORD(.. ALL > KNOWLEDGE > ADMINISTRATION > KNOWLEDGE BASES).... we add USER CRITERIA RECORDS to these tabs to control access to a KB 

  ***** if there's NO USER CRITERIA RECORD given in CAN READ TAB.... then the article is PUBLIC (?? even to NON LOGGED IN USERS...)

    ** to BLOCK NON LOGGED IN USERS access to KB... USE SYS PROPERTY
