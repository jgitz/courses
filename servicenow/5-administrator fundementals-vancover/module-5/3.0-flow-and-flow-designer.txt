- FLOW DESIGNER: is a NON-TECHNICAL INTERFACE for implementin PROCESS AUTOMATION known as FLOWS to AUTOMATE BUSINESS LOGIC or PROCESS such as TASK, APPROVAL, NOTIFICATIONS and RECORD OPERATIONS 


  ** to open FLOW DESIGNER 

    - ALL > PROCESS AUTOMATION > FLOW DESIGNER

  ** ROLES REQUIRED 

    - action_designer 

    - flow_designer

    - flow_operator 



- FLOWS: are used to automate BUSINESS LOGIC for APPLICATIONS or PROCESSES such as APPROVAL, TASKS, NOTIFICATION and RECORD OPERATIONS 

- BENIFITS of FLOWS

  - provides NATURAL LANGUAGE description of FLOW LOGIC

  - single environment to visualize and build BUISINESS PROCESS 
  
  - config and runtime info available to CREATE, OPERATE and TROUBLESHOUT FLOWS 

  - provide REUSABLE ACTIONS 

  - EXTEND FLOW DESIGNER using INTEGRATION HUB or installing SPOKES 

  - create various FLOW TRIGGERS like SLA TRIGGER 




** in snow there are THREE METHODS for PROCESS AUTOMATION   

  1) FLOWS (..using FLOW DESIGNER)

  2) WORKFLOW 

  3) PROCESS?? (..using PROCESS AUTOMATION DESIGNER)

  ** WORKFLOW is DEPRECATED and is only used to define flow in KNOWLEDGE BASE LIFECYCLE 

  ** FLOW is now the GOTO AUTOMATION TOOL to define FLOWS 

  ** PAD (..Process Automation Designer) is used to define process
