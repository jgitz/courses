- USER: is an individual that has been granted access to your instance 

  ** user has a USER ID and we can SET LOGIN PASSWORD 

  ** users are listed in sys_user table

  ** to add a user... goto ALL > USER ADMINISTRATION > USERS > new 

- GROUP: set of users for a common purpose.... EXAMPLES are given below 

  - SERVICE DESK 

  - KNOWLEDGE BASE AUTHORS 

  - HR ADMINISTRATORS 

  ** to see groups use sys_user_group.list 

  ** to add a group... goto ALL > USER ADMINISTRATION > GROUPS > NEW....click EDIT in group member RELATED LIST to add/remove users


- ROLES: are used to ACCESS CONTROL to regulate access to APPLICATIONS, MODULES and to create ACCESS CONTROL LIST 

  ** roles can be given to both USERS and GROUPS 

  ** a role can can consist of many other roles

  ** SELF SERVICE USERS: are users with NO ROLES ASSIGNED.... these users can still view various platform applications and do common actions where permission is NOT REQUIRED 

  ** best practice is to add users to a group and GIVE THE GROUP THE ROLE...  

    ***** in this case you cannot remove the role of the user from the USER RECORD.... to remove the role from a user.... you have to remove him from the GROUP RECORD


- USER IMPERSONATION: you can impersonate users in snow platform for testing purposes.... for effective testing create 3 USERS with following ROLES

  1) admin : to do the work

  2) itil: to test as process user 

  3) ess (employee self service): to test the end user 

  4) impersonator: is a role given to user so the USER can IMPERSONATE OTHER USERS for testing 

    ** IMPERSONATION can ONLY BE done by USERS WITH the roles ADMIN or IMPERSONATOR

  **** impersonations are LOGGED in system logs 

    $$ to see impersonation option to users glide.sys.log_impersonation needs to be set to TRUE in sys_property
