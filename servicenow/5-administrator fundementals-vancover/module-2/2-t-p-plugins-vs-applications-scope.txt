.... servicenow allows you to install plugins and applications in your instance 

- What is the difference between plugins and applications? 

  ** PLUGINS are EXCLUSIVELY DEVELOPED BY SERVICENOW 

    * APPLICATIONS ARE DEVELOPED BY SNOW PARTNERS as well as SERVICENOW 

  ** PLUGINS can use EITHER CUSTOM APPLICATION SCOPE or GLOBAL SCOPE 

    * APPLICATIONS are shipped with their CUSTOM APPLICATION SCOPE 

  ** PLUGINS range from TINY to LARGE PLUGINS 

    * APPLICATIONS are LARGER BUNDLES with LOTS OF FEATURES 


- From where can we install applications and plugins in the instance? 

  - BOTH APPLICATIONS and PLUGINS can be installed from APPLICATION MANAGER (via servicenow store??)

  - APPLICATIONS can exclusively be installed from the servicenow store site (url: store.servicenow.com)

  - to open application manager in the instance.... use either of the 2 below given paths: 

    - ALL > SYSTEM APPLICATIONS > ALL AVAILABLE APPLICATIONS > ALL 

    - ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > PLUGINS

** BEST PRACTICE BEFORE INSTALLING AN APPLICATION 

  - first look for the availability of the PLUGINS for the same in APPLICATION MANAGER 

  - if you don't find it.... goto SERVICENOW STORE WEBSITE (store.servicenow.com)
