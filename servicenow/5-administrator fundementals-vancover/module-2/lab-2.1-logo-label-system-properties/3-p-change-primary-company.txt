..... there are MANY COMPANIES in your instance.... but you can only manage ONE COMPANY at a time and change only ONE COMPANY'S LOGO and properties by going to ALL > SYSTEM PROPERTIES > MY COMPANY... 

.... so to change existing company and make ANOTHER COMPANY as PRIMARY COMPANY 

- goto companies list ALL > USER ADMINISTRATION > COMPANIES 

- edit LIST LAYOUT to show PRIMARY COLUMN 

- locate the COMPANY and change the value of PRIMARY to TRUE 

  ** ONLY ONE company can be made PRIMARY COMPANY at a time 

- now PROPERTIES of your NEW COMPANY will come up in ALL > SYSTEM PROPERTIES > MY COMPANY
