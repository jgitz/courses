- UI POLICY: is a RULE applied to a FORM to DYNAMICALLY change information or the FORM ITSELF?? 

  ** UI POLICY is used in CLIENT SIDE 

  ** UI POLICY only APPLIES to data entered on a FORM through a STANDARD BROWSER

  ** UI POLICY is REAL-TIME 

  ** UI POLICY requires NO SCRIPTING and CUSTOM FLOWS?? (** BUT there is an option to add scripts in SCRIPT TAB)

  ** UI POLICY is used on FORMS and LISTS??

  ** UI POLICY is used to IMMEDIATELY implement UPDATES

  ** UI POLICY is used to SET the FOLLOWING properties to the FIELDS 

    1) MANDATORY/OPTIONAL (..form WON'T SAVE if the mandatory fields are left blank)

    2) HIDDEN/VISIBLE (..fields become invisible if hidden)

    3) READ-ONLY/EDITABLE (.. prevent user from UPDATING FORM VALUE)

  ** to create UI POLICY on a FORM RECORD 

    - RECORD FORM > ADDITIONAL ACTION > CONFIGURE > UI POLICY > select NEW in UI POLICIES LIST 

    ** or goto ALL > SYSTEM UI > UI POLICIES > new

  **** UI POLICY is NOT ABOUT SECURITY.... it's about USER EXPERIENCE adnd DATA INTEGRITY 

  **** in REALITY... UI POLICY is USED TO set CONDITIONS (..in when to apply tab) to TRIGGER UI POLICY ACTIONS.... the MANDATORY, HIDDEN, READONLY FIELDS are set in UI POLICY ACTIONS (..ui policy action tab in ui policy form)
