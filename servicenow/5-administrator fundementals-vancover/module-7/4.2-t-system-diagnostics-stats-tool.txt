- STATS TOOL: helps in PERFORMANCE EVALUATION and SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS 

  - IT GIVES statistics FOR system activities SUCH AS execution of 

    - QUERIES

    - SCRIPTS 

    - TRANSACTIONS

  ** to use it... goto ALL > SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS > STATS 

  ** use stats.do to see ALL SYSTEM STATS DETAILS in CONTENT FRAME 

  ** STATS TOOL plugin is ACTIVATED BY DEFAULT 

** STATS MODULE MONITORS the ACTIVITY PATTERN in the FOLLOWING 3 TABLES 

  1) sys_query_pattern  (.. ALL > SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS > STATS > SLOW QUERIES)

  2) sys_script_pattern (.. ALL > SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS > STATS > SLOW SCRIPTS)

  3) sys_transaction_pattern (.. ALL > SYSTEM DIAGNOSTICS > STATS > SLOW TRANSACITIONS)

  ** each PATTERN TABLE represents COLLECTION OF UNIQUE ACTIVITIES 

  ** each RECORD in PATTERN TABLE provide basic TIMING ANALYSIS 

  ** for BETTER DEBUGGING... FILTER the logs by APPLICATION SCOPES 


** ACTIVITY PATTERNS are IMMEDIATELY RECORDED to a CACHE.... and then FROM THE CACHE they ARE PERSISTED (STORED) to their PATTERN TABLE 

  **** if you FLUSH SERVER CACHE.... the all the ACTIVITY PATTERNS which are NOT PERSISTED will be LOST FROM THE CACHE 

** HOW ARE ACTIVITY PATTERNS RECOGNIZED... EXPLAIN using EXAMPLES 

  - each time a QUERY is executed... if the query MEETS the RECORDING and PERSISTENCE THRESHOLD... it is STORED in QUERY PATTERN RECORD 

  - each time a BUSINESS RULE is executed... it is STORED in SCRIPT PATTERN 

  - each time a BACKGROUND JOB is run.... it gets stored in TRANSACTION PATTERN RECORD 

  - each time you click a UI BUTTON (UI ACTION)...eg NEW BUTTON... it is stored as a LIST TYPE TRANSACTION PATTERN with SPECIFIC FORM ACTION ??
