- UPDATE SET: is a GROUP of CONFIGURATION CHANGES that can be moved from ONE INSTANCE to ANOTHER INSTANCE 

  ** UPDATE SET is XML FILE 

  ** an INSTANCE will always have a DEFAULT UPDATE SET 

  ** we can CREATE NEW UPDATE SETS and its called NAMED UPDATE SETS 

  ** We can CREATE MULTIPLE update sets and MERGE THEM 

  ** BATCH UPDATE SETS: enable you to group UPDATESET together... PREVIEW them AND  COMMIT them in BULK 

  ** if multiple changes happens to a configuration... the MOST RECENT CHANGE is added to UPDATE SET 

  ** main USE CASE of update set: move config data from DEVELOPER INSTANCE... to TESTING INSTANCE and to PRODUCTION INSTANCE 

  **** DATA is NOT CAPTURED in an UPDATE SET.... ONLY CONFIG RECORDS are captured in update set 

  **** DON'T USE DEFAULT update set to TRANSFER CONFIG CHANGES.... always use NAMED UPDATE SETS to transfer config changes 

- What all INSTANCE RECORDS can be TRACKED and ADDED TO UPDATE SETS? 

  - UPDATE SET is used to TRACK and ADD the the following PROCESS RECORDS 

    - roles 

    - tables 
    - list CONFIGURATION 
    - form and form sections
    - views 
    - fields 

    - flows/published-workflows 

    - UI POLICIES 
    - CLIENT SCRIPTS 
    - BUSINESS RULES 

    - REPORT DEFINITIONS  

    **** even though DASHBOARDS are NOT TRACKED BY the UPDATE SET.... any PORTAL PAGES related to DASHBOARD can be ADDED to UPDATE SET by usint UNLOAD DASHBOARD FUNCTION 

- WHAT all RECORDS are NOT CAPTURED BY UPDATE SETS? 

  - update sets DON'T CAPTURE DATA RECORDS such as 

    - NEW USERS/GROUPS 
    - NEW DATA RECORDS 
    - MODIFIED DATA RECORDS 
    - TASKS 
    - MODIFIED CI'S 

    - DASHBOARDS 
    - SCHEDULED JOBS 
    - SCHEDULES

- what are the STATES of UPDATE SET RECORD 

  - there are THREE STATES 

    1) IN PROGRESS :  choose this if you want the s/m to keep on adding config changes to this update set 

    2) COMPLETED :  choose this if you want to STOP ADDING CHANGES to the update set... and PREPARE the UPDATE SET for MIGRATION/EXPORT 

    3) IGNORE?? 

    ***** once you set state to COMPLETED... DON'T change the STATE again to IN PROGRESS to ADD CONFIG CHANGES.... INSTEAD 

        ** create a NEW UPDATE SET to add changes and COMMIT the UPDATE SETS in ORDER 

- where can you see CONFIG CHANGES HAPPENING in the instance? 

  - config record changes that are TRACKED by an UPDATE SET is stored in TABLE NAMED CUSTOMER UPDATE TABLE

    - sys_update_xml

  **** the CUSTOMER UPDATE TABLE records relevant to a an UPDATE SET can be VIEWED inside CUSTOMER UPDATES RELATED LIST TAB in UPDATE SET RECORD

** BEST PRACTICES: 

  - LIMIT UPDATE SET to MAX 100 RECORDS to REDUCE CONFLICTS 

  - ENSURE all records have MATCHING SYS_ID in both instances involved in migration 

  - ADDITIONAL TESTING should be done if update sets migration instances are of DIFFERENT RELEASES

- UPDATE SET and SCOPE PICKER ICON (GLOBE ICON): 

  - we use SCOPE PICKER ICON to view CURRENT UPDATE SET and we can use it to CHANGE UPDATE SET TOO 

  - SCOPE PICKER > click UPDATE SET TAB 

    - you can SEARCH BOX to search for an available update set 

    - click on OPEN LIST ICON (..list icon) to open UPDATE SET LIST (..all > system update sets > local update sets)...

    - click on OPEN RECORD ICON (..paper icon).. to open the UPDATE SET RECORD of CURRENT UPDATE SET 

    - click on + ICON to create NEW UPDATE SET 

    ** if the CURRENT UPDATE set is ANY OTHER UPDATE SET other than GLOBAL... there is RED OUTLINE around the APPLICATION SCOPE PICKER ICON
