... another method to design is to use FORM DESIGN (form context menu > configure > form design)

- PARTS OF FORM DESIGN PAGE 

  - PAGE HEADER: top most navbar where we can do ACTIONS like UNDO, SAVE etc 

  - FIELD NAVIGATOR: left panel and has the FOLLOWING SUB PANELS 

    - FIELDS TAB: lists all the AVAILABLE FIELDS for the SELECTED TABLE on which the form is made 

    - FIELD TYPES: lists field types to NEW FIELDS to be added to form via FORM DESIGN STUDIO 

      ** NEW FIELDS MADE in studio will be added to the SELECTED TABLE on which the form is made 

    - FILTER TAB: to search FIELDS or FIELDS TYPE 

    - FORMATTERS: is a type of FORM ELEMENT where we can display information which is not a FIELD in the record 

  - FORM LAYOUT: is the big part where the FORM LAOUT is graphically represented with FIELDS, SECTIONS, and other elements 

  - SECTION: allows to DIVIDE the form fields into separate logical groups 

    ** if you NAME THE SECTIONS in the form studio.... it gets DISPLAYED AS TABS in the CLASSIC FORM 




***** the FORM in FORM DESIGN STUDIO TURNS PINK if you are not in the CORRECT SCOPE.... in that case.... it won't allow working on the form
