.... every info in snow platform is stored in a RELATIONAL DATABASE 

... the important THREE DATASTRUCTURES in SERVICENOW ARE 

  1) TABLE:

    - to view all tables.. ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > TABLES 

    ** OR DO sys_db_object.list

  2) RECORD: 

    - SYS_ID: is a UNIQUE 32 bit id for EACH RECORD 

    ** TO CHANGE the RECORD NUMBER FORMAT of a table... goto

      - ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > NUMBER MAINTENANCE

  3) FIELD:

    - to view all fields.. ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > DICTIONARY (sys_dictionary.list)

    ** to view all FIELD LABELS (LANGUAGE FILE)... ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > LANGUAGE FILE (sys_documentation.list) 

    - FIELD ATTRIBUTES: are important parts that makes a field.... each field has THREE FIELD ATTRIBUTES 

      3.1) FIELD LABEL: user-friendly name for HUMANS

      3.2) FIELD NAME : SYSTEM_FRIENDLY UNIQUE name of system to identify field and use it

        ** should be UNIQUE 

        ** DOES NOT ALWAYS MATCH FIELD LABEL  

      3.3) FIELD DATA: actual data VALUE given in the field

  4) FIELD VALUE: intersection fo FIELD AND RECORD 
 

** what are DATA DICTIONARY TABLES in servicenow platform ?

  - They are tables that DEFINE DATABASE ELEMENTS (tables, fields, field labels)

  - the THREE DATA DICTIONARY TABLES are 

    1) sys_db_object.list (TABLES)
    2) sys_dictionary.list (FIELDS)
    3) sys_documentation.list (FIELD LABELS)

** WHAT is SCHEMA MAP? 

  - provides GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION of RELATIONSHIP B/W TABLES 


**** CREATING CUSTOM TABLES in snow need LICENSE 

**** tables made by EXTENDING CMDB TABLE (cmdb) DON'T need LICENSE

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 

... to create a table... use any of the path below 

  - ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > TABLES 

  - ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > TABLES & COLUMNS

  ** when a table is created.... A ROLE in the NAME OF THE TABLE with SCOPE PREFIX (u_ or x_ AND the name end with _user eg u_<table>_user) is also created automatically and added to ROLES TABLE (ALL > SYSTEM SECURITY > USERS and GROUPS > ROLES || ALL > USER ADMINISTRATION > ROLES)

  ** the following ACCESS CONTROL RULE IS AUTOMATICALLY ADDED TO THE TABLE 

    - create 
    - read
    - write 
    - delete

  **** BEST PRACTICE: before table creation.... check if there is already a table with the fields you want.... then use EXTENSION TABLES... instead of making table from scratch....
