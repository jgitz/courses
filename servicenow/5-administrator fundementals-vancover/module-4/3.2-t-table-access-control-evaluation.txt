.... so in this note....we discuss the SETPS on EVALUATION of ACCESS CONTROL RULE when user requests for access to an OBJECT (TABLE/FIELD) in snow.... 

- SETP 1: user requests ACCESS to OBJECT (TABLE/FIELD)

- STEP 2: s/m searched in ALL > SYSTEM SECURITY > ACCESS CONTROL for 

    2.1) search for MATCHING TABLE ACL RULES ... continues to next step 

    2.2) search for MATCHING FIELD ACL RULES....

    ** BOTH TABLE & FIELD AC RULES should be MATCHED to grand access to an OBJECT 

    ** if a USER FAILS matching TABLE ACL RULE.... then the user is DENIED ACCESS to ALL FIELDS in the table 

    ** if the user PASS the TABLE MATCHING RULE and FAILS the FIELD matching ACL RULE.... then the user is DENIED ACCESS to the FIELD 

- STEP 3: if s/m matches BOTH TABLE & FIELD RULE.... then system checks if the USER HAS PERMISSION to access the OBJECT....

  - PERMISSION: permission in ACL RULE form can be given through 

    - CONDITIONS 
    - ROLES 
    - SCRIPTS 

    ** if a permission is defined by above 3.... then all the 3 permission should be satisfied 

    ** in case of ROLES..... ANY ONE of LISTED ROLES should be posessed by the USER 

    ** s/m DENIES ACCESS if any PERMISSION IS NOT SATISFIED  


** ACL RULES applied to a PARENT TABLE.... will be INHERITED to CHILD TABLE and its FIELDS
