.... sometimes we need to import data from other data sources.... 

** DATA of the following FORMATS can be acceptable DATA SOURCES for servicenow platform

  ** Network sources 
    - JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity)
    - LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
    - HTTP/FTP

  ** LOCAL SOURCES 
  - EXCEL 
  - CSV 
  - XML 

- IMPORT SET TABLE: is a STAGING TABLE to store the DATA IMPORTED from the DATA SOURCES 

  ** existing import sets can be REUSED 

  ** even if there is no fields in import set to accomodate fields from the data source.... new FIELDS will be AUTOMATICALLY ADDED

  ** a SINGLE IMPORT SET FIELD can be MAPPED to MULTIPLE FIELDS (..while using transform maps)

- TARGET TABLE: is an existing table in snow to which we want to add data from data sources

- TRANSFORM MAP: is a guide form moving DATA from IMPORT SET TABLE... to a TARGET TABLE in snow

  - it provides a set of FIELD MAPS to define RELATIONSHIP b/w the import table fields and target table field  

  - TRANFORM MAP is FLEXIBLE... it has AUTO MAP FEATURE as well as ADVANCED LOGIC can be implemented using SCRIPTING 

  ** a SINGLE IMPORT SET can be MAPPED to MULTIPLE FIELDS (..while using transform maps)

  - fields can be mapped in transform map using TWO UTILITIES 

    1) AUTOMATIC MAPPING UTILITY: using this will automatically map the fields of IMPORT SET TABLE and TARGET TABLE 

    2) MAPPING ASSIST UTILITY: provides GUI to manually map the fields 

      ** it allows to map a SINGLE SOURCE FIELD (from import set table) to  MULTIPLE DESTINATION FIELDS on the target table 

- COALESCE FIELDS: is used to make A SINGLE FIELD or MULTIPLE FIELD as UNIQUE KEYS during imports (??..applied on IMPORT SET TABLE)

  ** if A MATCH IS FOUND for coalesce field  f in both tables.... then field values on target table is UPDATED with the new data 

  ** if a MATCH IS NOT FOUND for coalesce field in both tables.... then NEW RECORD is added to the TARGET TABLE 

  ** THERE ARE 3 TYPES OF COALESCE in IMPORT SETS 

    1) SINGLE FIELD COALSCE: use coalesce on a single field 

    2) MULTIPLE FIELD COALESCE: multiple fields can be used as coalesce 

    3) CONDITIONAL COALESCE: use SCRIPT to set condition whether a field in IMPORT SET TABLE should COALESCE to TARGET TABLE FIELD  


** BEST PRACTICES 

  1) UNDERSTAND and VERIFY what DATA you are importing 

  2) DATA SHOULD NOT be in BIG CHUNKS 

  3) DON'T CREATE a LARGE IMPORT SET...it causes DELAYS 

  4) IMPORT SET TABLE NAME should be similar to the DATA SOURCE FILE NAME 

  5) you can SCHEDULE IMPORTS
