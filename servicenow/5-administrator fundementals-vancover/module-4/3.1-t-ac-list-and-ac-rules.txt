- ACCESS CONTROL LIST: is a list of ACCESS CONTROL RULES.... you can see the list from the FOLLOWING PATHS 

  - ALL > SYSTEM SECURITY > ACCESS CONTROL 

  ** to view ACCESS CONTROL RULE LIST of a SPECIFIC TABLE.... on FILE NAVIGATOR (..all menu)... type 

    <table name>.config

- PARTS OF ACCESS CONTROL RULE: an access control RULE is created by FILLING the FOLLWING FIELDS in a FORM obtained in path ALL > SYSTEM SECURITY > ACCESS CONTROL > new (.. login as security_admin)

  1) OPERATION: a valid snow operation (create, write etc) which need to be applied to an OBJECT (TABLE, FIELD etc)

  2) OBJECT: is the snow instance OBJECT that is needed to be SECURED using ACCESS CONTROL RULE and APPLY the OPERATION 

    - the object is INPUTTED in the FORM using the NAME FIELD.... the name field has 2 INPUT FIELD

      - FIRST FIELD is used to specify the TABLE 

      - SECOND FIELD is used to specify the FIELD of the TABLE 

      **** NAME FIELDS (first field, second field) COMBINATION will be discussed LATER in the note

    3) PERMISSION: permission required to access the TABLE/FIELD can be given in 3 WAYS 

      1) ROLES 
      2) CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION 
      3) SCRIPTS 

_____________________________________________________

** NAME FIELDS (first field, second field) COMBINATION:

  1) <table>.<none/blank>: means WHOLE TABLE is selected to apply the AC RULE 

  2) <table>.<field>: means a FIELD of the table is selected and the ac rule is applied to the field 

    **** the other users would be DENIED ACCESS to the SPECIFC FIELD (**even if a read access is given to other users using NONE RULE) unless another rule is written for the users

  3) <table>.*: means all the FIELDS... EXCEPT any ac rule defined by <table>.<field> is selected to apply the AC RULE 

    ** this method allows us to write LESS NUMBER of AC RULES 

    **** the other users would be DENIED ACCESS to the FIELDS (**even if a read access is given to other users using NONE RULE)  unless another rule is written for the users 

  ** IMPORTANT USE CASE of the COMBINATION 

    1) <table>.<none/blank>: is used to GRANT ACCESS to all ROWS and FIELDS of the TABLE 

    2) <table>.*: is used to DENY ACCESS to ALL OTHER ROLES even to the fields given access through <table>.<none/blank>

    3) <table>.<field>: used to OVERRIDE and GIVE PRECEDENCE to a RULE applied to the SAME FIELD using <table>.* 

  **** BEST PRACTICES 

    - when creating a <table>.<*>.... ALSO CREATE a <table>.<none/blank>

    - to MOSTLY GRANT ACCESS.... use <table>.<none/blank>

    - to MOSTLY DENY ACCESS.... use <table>.*
