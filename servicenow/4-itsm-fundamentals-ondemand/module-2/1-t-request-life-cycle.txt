.... OUR FOCUS is to use SERVICE CATALOG to make requests and manage it 

.... service catalog is used to REQUEST FOR CATALOG ITEMS.... any PRODUCTS or SERVICES can be REQUESTED using the following service catalog items: 

  - RECORD PRODUCERS: make requests by filling questions or adding information from records such as incident record 

  - ORDER GUIDES: group multiple catalog items in one request 

  - CONTENT ITEMS : are catalog items that provide INFORMATION (KNOWLEDGE ARTICLES?? ) instead of goods or services 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- REQUEST MANAGEMENT LIFECYCLE: is the life cycle of a REQUEST which is made through SERVICE CATALOG..... there are 4 STAGES in this lifecycle 

  1) SUBMITTAL: user selects ONE or MORE items from the SERVICE CATALOG and make the request (submit the order)

    - states
      - pending approval 
      - approved

  2) APPROVAL: some requests need APPROVAL for overall requests... or some requests need APPROVAL for individual ITEMS in the request.... some requests need NO APPROVAL 

    - notify approvers about the request 

    - APPROVE or REJECT request

    - states 

      - requested 
      - approved 
      - rejected

    ** approval is triggered AUTOMATICALLY on REQUEST SUBMITTAL 

    ** based on the organisational needs... APPROVAL can be set at 2 PLACES....   

      1) GATING APPROVAL : when APPROVAL is set at the REQUEST (REQ) LEVEL.... i.e when a request is SUBMITTED.... it waits for an APPROVAL 

        ** if gating approval is REJECTED.... then entire order is REJECTED/CANCELLED

      2) PROCESS APPROVAL approval set for each item at RITM level such that the FULFILLER workflow process only starts after this approval 

        ** if one of the RITM approval is rejected among order request of multiple items.... the REQ is NOT CANCELLED/REJECTED..... the order proceeds with the remaining requested item workflow 

      ** when GATING APPROVAL and PROCESS approval is approved.... SCTASK record is created automatically by the workflow 

  3) FULFILLMENT: once APPROVAL is got..... FULFILLER needs to complete PREDEFINED series of TASKS (defined by the workflow) to fulfill EACH ITEM in the order.... 

    - view workflow and see ALL TASKs to be completed to fulfill the request

    - locate the task and perform the task 

    - UPDATE TASK RECORD 

    

  4) CLOSURE: the request is CLOSED when all requested itms within a request have been fulfilled and closed 


  ** RECORDS created in REQUEST LIFE CYCLE 

    - REQUEST RECORD (REQ): is a record created at SUBMITTAL STAGE.... it consists of the details of ONE or MORE REQUESTED ITEMS.... REQ is a unique number for each order

    - REQUESTED ITEM RECORD (RITM) : consists details of each REQUESTED ITEM..... it MAY also consists of the information about FULFILLMENT STAGE or PRICE of the item.... RITM is a uniqe number to identify the individual requests

    - CATALOG TASK RECORD (SCTASK) : refers to the TASKs that the FULFILLER need to complete to deliver the request.... these tasks should be ASSIGNED and COMPLETED inorder to deliver the requested itom
