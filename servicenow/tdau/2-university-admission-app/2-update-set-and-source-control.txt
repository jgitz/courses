.... in snow platform.... SOURCE CONTROL can be acheived via 2 METHODS 

  1) using INBUILT UPDATE SET feature in SNOW INSTANCE 

  2) using GITLAB 

  ** both has its use cases and advantages and disadvantages 


- UPDATE SET: 

    - update set use XML to trach changes in the app 

      ** NOT ALL CHANGES are tracked by update set 

    - whenever you create an app in STUDIO.... a DEFAULT UPDATE SET in the NAME  of the app is created in the SNOW INSTANCE 

    - to see the update sets in SNOW INSTANCE do: 

        - click all 

        - SEARCH for LOCAL UPDATE SET (under system update set)

    ** NEVER BUILD the whole app in the DEFAULT UPDATE SET.... always create NEW UPDATE SET when you add new feature 

    - to make a NEW UPDATE SET... in instance do:

        - open LOCAL UPDATE SETS 

        - click new 

        - name: <1-<app>-<sub name>>

            * eg: 01-uniAccess-base-application 

        - description: <any>
