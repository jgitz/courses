- snow allows us to create 4 TYPES of UI'S 

  1) WORKSPACE 

  2) STANDARD CATALOG ITEM 

  3) RECORD PRODUCER

- SERVICE CATALOG: is a SELF SERVICE in snow that allows us to ORDER CATALOG ITEMS.....   (BESIDES service catalog... other cataloges are TECHNICAL CATALOG & RESOURCES CATALOG)

  - There are 4 components for service catalog 

    1) STANDARD CATALOG ITEMS: GOODS or SERVICES with its specifications that we order through service now... eg laptop, mobiles etc 

    2) CATAGORIES: catalog items are LOGICALLY grouped into catagories.... eg phone, laptop etc goes into HARDWARE CATAGORY 

      ** same item CAN be added to TWO or more catagories

    3) RECORD PRODUCERS: allows you to CREATE FORMS and add RECORDS to a TABLE 

      ** RECORD PRODUCERS take data from the users by ASKING QUESTIONS 

      ** record producer is a type of catalog item

    4) ORDER GUIDES: allows you to order MULTIPLE CATALOG ITEMS in one REQUEST 

      ** order guide is a type of catalog item

    5) CONTENT ITEMS: catalog items which PROVIDE INFORMATION INSTEAD OF GOODS

      ** content item is a type of catalog item
