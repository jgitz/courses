..... you can desingn web components in snow in 2 ways 

  1) using SERVICE PORTAL 

    - used to create REQUESTER EXPERIENCES 

    - built on ANGULAR 

    -EMPLOYEE SERVICE CENTER is the current recommended service portal 

    - is RESPONSIVE

    - provides PIXEL PERFECT DESIGN 

    - ATF testing

    - full support from SERVICE CATALOG
    
    - DIFFICULT to set up PUBLIC PAGES 

    - used to make

        - enterprise portals 

        - customer portals

  2) using UI BUILDER

    - used to create FULFILLER EXPERIENCE 

    - is similar to react and is component based 

    - is NOT RESPONSIVE

    - DOESNOT provide pixel perfect design

    - LIMITED SUPPORT from service catalog

    - NO testing can be done using ATF

    - used to make 

        - workspaces 
        
        - small portals 

        - departmental portals

    ** UI builder is NOT as CAPABLE as SERVICE PORTAL 

    ** WORKSPACE: is a GUI for AGENTS that shows MULTIPLE TOOLS on one page to HANDLE USER REQUESTS

    ** PORTAL: is a page where USERS can 

      - create REQUESTS 

      - TRACK TICKETS 

      - SEARCH KNOWLEDGE BASE 

      ... etc
