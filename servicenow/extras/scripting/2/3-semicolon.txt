....in snow instance console (scripts - background)..... we use SEMOCOLON ; to separate 2 statements 

** SOME STATEMENTS use ; at the END and SOME DON'T 

** STATEMENTS that DON'T need SEMI-COLON at the end 

  - for loop 
  - while loop
  - if and else 

** STATEMENTS THAT use SEMI-COLON at the end 

  - do while loop
