- APPLICATION SCOPE: protects application from outside access on its data and resources...

  ** APPLICATIONS build before the application scoping are in GLOBAL SCOPE

  ** ALL CUSTOM APPLICATIONS has their own APPLICATION SCOPE

  ** application scope prevents another application from accessing its TABLE and BUSINESS LOGIC 

- UPDATE SET: is an XML FILE that records all the CONFIGURATION CHANGES that we've made in the instance so these configuration changes can be PACKAGED to other instance 

  ** the changes are stored in the table CUSTOMER UPDATE (sys_update_xml)

  ** several update sets can be made.... if two update set has made CHANGES to configuration of a specific object.... then the LATEST CHANGE will get applied when MERGING UPDATE SET

  ** you can SET or CREATE NEW UPDATE set in ALL > SYSTEM UPDATE SETS > LOCAL UPDATE SETS

  ** the main use of update set is to TRANSFER CONFIGURATION of DEVELOPER INSTANCE to TESTING INSTANCE and to PRODUCTION INSTANCE 

  ** the DEFAULT UPDATE SET captures changes but WON'T ADD to and USER CREATED UPDATE SET (aka NAMED UPDATE SET)

  ** BATCH UPDATE SET enable you to GROUP UPDATE SETS... PREVIEW them and COMMIT them in BULK

  

  ** UPDATE SET TRACK CHANGES OF: 

    - tables
    - fields 
    - roles 
    - views 
    - published workflows
    - report definitions 
    - forms and form sections 
    - business rules 
    - client scripts

  **** UPDATE SET DO NOT INCLUDE: 

    - new users 
    - new groups 
    - new data records 
    - modified data records 
    - modifies CATALOG ITEMS 
    - tasks 
    - schedules 
    - scheduled jobs 
    - dashboards

  ** EXPORT XML FUNCTION: if you want data to be transferred to another instance.... we use XPORT XML function 

  ** UNLOAD DASHBOARD FUNCTION: if you want DASHBOARD to be .... we use UNLOAD DASHBOARD FUCNTION..

  **** AVOID USING DEFAULT UPDATE SET to transfer config data to other instances

  **** once you set UPDATE SET TO COMPLETE.... NEVER REVERT ITS STATE to IN PROGRESS.... INSTEAD 

    ** make a NEW UPDATE SET.... and give proper NUMBER NAMING CONVENTION..... and COMMIT THEM IN ORDER 

    - then we export it.. (read next note)

- UPDATE SET RETRIEVAL IN OTHER INSTANCE 

  .... update set can be transferred to another instance in 2 ways....

    1) upload the update set xml file to the target instance 

      - goto ALL > SYSTEM UPDATE SETS > RETRIEVED UPDATE SETS 

      - IMPORT UPDATE SET FROM XML 
      
      - choose xml file and upload

    2) retreive the update set from the source instance using REMOTE CONNECTION....

      - goto ALL > SYSTEM UPDATE SETS > UPDATE SOURCES > NEW 

        - complete the fields to set REMOTE CONNECTION to the source instance
