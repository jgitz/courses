.... here we look into 2 types of fields in the form 

  1) choice: we can choose options from dropdown 
    ** identified by DOWN ARROW icon 

  2) reference field: takes values from another table 

    ** identified by MAGNIFYING GLASS icon

- open a list

- check if the view is default (HAMBURGER > VIEW > <DEFAULT>)

- open a record
