.... each record on the table is a FORM with fields filled....

.... form can be designed in 2 ways 

    1) form design: we design form in the STUDIO (FORM HAMBURGER > CONFIGURE > FORM DESIGN)

      ** you need to set appropriate application scope to work in studio

      ** CANNOT set REFERENCE FIELDS using DOT WALKING

    2) form layout: we design form in the instance

      - uses LIST COLLECTOR (with available and selected box to set fields)

      - can DOT WALK and use REFERENCE FIELDS

- RELATED LIST: is the TABS at the end of a form/record... these are LISTS which are related to the form 

    ** we can also CONFIGURE this by using (RECORD > HAMBURGER > RELATED LIST) 

        - add relevant fields to get displayed as related list 


***** FORM DESIGN and FORM LAYOUT will alter the form display for ALL USERS 

***** USE TUNING SWITCH BUTTONS (PERSONALIZE) to personalize the form display for you and OTHER USERS are NOT AFFECTED 

  - check the fields you want to display
  - uncheck the fields you want to hide
  - mandatory fields CANNOT be hidden 
  - if you leve the form... you've to reset personalization again 

  - To disable personalize form for the itil
    role, navigate to sys_properties.list find the property glide.ui.personalize_form.role and set
    the Value to admin (to specify the role that can access form personalization).

  **** to personalize forms in workspace interface 

    - open a record in workspace 

    - goto details tab 

    - click 3 DOTS on top left 

    - check or uncheck fields 

    - update form
