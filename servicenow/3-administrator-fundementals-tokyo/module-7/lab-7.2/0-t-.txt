..ACCESS CONTROL and SECURITY IN SERVICENOW..

... snow provides THREE LEVELS of SECURITY 

  1) USER AUTHENTICATION/LOGIN: enforced using 

    - user 
    - groups
    - roles

  2) APPLICATION and MODULE ACCESS: enforced using ROLES 

  3) DATABASE ACCESS: snow allows to restrict access to TABLES, FIELDS and RECORDS 

    - enforced using 

      **?? GLOBAL SYSTEM PROPERTIES 

      **?? ACCESS CONTROL RULES 

      **** DEFAULT access status to database is DENY 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- the THREE SECURITY MODULES used for ACCESS CONTROL IS 

  1) ALL > SYSTEM PROPERTIES > SECURITY 

  2) ALL > SYSTEM SECURITY > ACCESS CONTROL (ACL)

  3) ALL > SYSTEM SECURITY > HIGH SECURITY SETTINGS

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>



- SNOW INSTANCE OPERATIONS that can be given through access controls

  - all CRUD operations to TABLES, RECORDS and FIELDS.... the permission includes operations below 

    - create 
    - delete
    - read 
    - write

  - execute: user cannot execute scripts on a RECORD or UI PAGE 

  - Edit_ci_relations: user cannot define relationship between CI'S  in CONFIGURATION ITEM CMDB TABLEs (cmdb_ci)

  - Save_as_template: controls the FIELD that should be SAVED as TEMPLATE when created ??

  - Report_on: user cannot create reports on objects 

  - Personalize_choices: user cannot RIGHT CLICK and CONFIGURE choice field in forms

  **** besides these there are many operations 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- ADMINS in snow:

  - SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR is the top level admin 

  - USERS can also be given ADMIN role 

  - SECURITY_ADMIN is the SUPER ADMIN above SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR 

    ** ONLY SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR can elevate to SECURITY ADMIN ROLE 

    ** ONLY SECURITY_ADMIN can access to HIGH SECURITY SETTINGS and ACCESS CONTROLs

    **** even a USER with ADMIN ROLE CANNOT elevate to SECUTITY ADMIN.... only SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR can elevate to SECUTITY_ADMIN role??

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- ACL (Access Control List): is a TABLE that consists of ACCESS CONTROL RULES for OBJECTS in the snow platform.... objects can be tables, fields etc 

  - to access acl table goto: ALL > SYSTEM SECURITY > ACCESS CONTROL (ACL)

    ** ACL table consists of access control rule RECORDS/FORMS which consists of following FIELDS: 

      - type: the type of object

      - operation: the CRUD operation you want to give access

      - name: name of the OBJECT ()

      - you can also set 

        - roles
        - conditional expression for access
        - scripts 

    ** when a CUSTOM TABLE is created.... by default CRUD access (create, delete, read write) is granted to the table BY DEFAULT.... also a ROLE is created?? 

- to view ACCESS CONTROLS RULES associated with a TABLE...

  - on the ALL menu... type 

      <table name>.config 

  - click ACCESS CONTROLS TAB

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


- ACCESS CONTROL RULES for a TABLE and its FIELDS can be given to 3 components of a table 

  1) NONE RULE:  to give access control to ENTIRE rows and fields TABLE.... give --None-- option (<table>.--None--)

  2) FIELD RULE: to give access control to a field in the table.... give the FIELD NAME as the option (<table>.<field>)

  3) * RULE:  to give access control to ALL THE OTHER FIELDS that are NOT GIVEN ACCESS CONTOL.... give the * option (<table>.*) 

  ** the above 3 are called RULES.... when applying MIX of these rules to a table and its fields.... there can be CONFLICTS in rules.... to avoid this there is a PRECIDENCE to the 3 rules.... 

     FIELD RULE > * RULE > NONE RULE 

  ** BEST PRACTICES for setting rules for a table: 

    - whenever you create a * RULE for a table.... CREATE a NONE RULE AS WELL

    - whenever you want to give ACCESS ONLY... ONLY USE NONE RULE 

    - whenever you want to give DENY RULE.... use NONE and STAR

- ACCESS CONTROL WORKING

  ... when a user request access to a RECORD OBJECT... the following happens in the background 

    - step1: the snow check for the TABLE matching related to the object and check for AC rules defined for the TABLE... in TABLE, PARENT TABLE and in *(ALL TABLE)....

      - if table match is found... the next step is to check ACL FIELD RULE for the record

      - if no table match is found... access is DENIED 

    - step 2: if table acl rule is found.... the snow checks for FIELD ACL RULEs.... and if BOTH FIELD ACL AND TABLE ACL RULE is found... ACCESS is granted to the user
    
    - if there is NO matching AC RULE for TABLE and FIELD AC rules.... then the USER is given access

    **** both TABLE ACL RULE and FIELD ACL rule should be SATISFIED by the user to get access..... absence of ANY ONE will DENY ACCESS
