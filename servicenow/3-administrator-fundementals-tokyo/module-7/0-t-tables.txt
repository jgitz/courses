.... everything in snow platfom is stored in a RELATIONAL DATABASE  

.... this database includes 

  - tables : is the basic component of a database and a database consists of multiple tables 

  - records (rows of the table): basic component of a table 
  - fields(columns of the table): individual data component of a record 

..... snow platforms have many inbuild tables such as .... INCIDENT, PROBLEM, CHANGE, CMDB(configuration management DATABASE: records/tables? of every CONFIGURATION ITEMS (hardware, software etc) used in the organisation using the snow platform )

- SYSTEM DICTIONARY: contains all the TABLES and FIELDS used in your snow platform.... to view it 

  - goto: ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > DICTIONARY

  ** ?? administratiors can also use the following tools 

    - Tables module: Provides a list of all tables in the database.

    - Tables & Columns module: Provides a list of all existing tables, with columns, column attributes, and indexes.

    - Schema map: Provides a graphical representation of the relationships between tables.

    - Data dictionary tables: Contains additional information that defines database elements.

- SYS_ID: all the RECORDS in tables of SNOW has a UNIQUE 32 CHARACTER LONG ID

- RECORD NUMBERING: to change NUMBERING FORMAT of records... goto 

  ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > NUMBER MAINTENANCE

- FIELD TYPE: defines the type of input taken by the field like string, choice etc 

- to see addetional FIELD SETTINGS and ATTRIBUTES of tables... goto 

  ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > TABLES & COLUMNS

- FIELD ATTRIBUTES to define field are 

  - FIELD LABEL 
  - FIELD NAME 
  - FIELD DATA (VALUE)

- REFERENCE FIELD (MAGNIFYING GLASS/INFO ICON): is a field that take a RECORD FROM ANOTHER RECORD as value 

  ** magnifying glass icon allows you to select record and input into the field 

  ** info icon on a completed record field allows you to view tha record

- TABLE RELATIONSHIPS: define the relationship between 2 or more tables in snow platform.... there are 4 table relationships 

  1) ONE TO MANY: examples 
  
    - table with REFERENCE FIELD that takes RECORD from another table as data 

    - GLIDE LIST: is a field that allows to TAKE MULTIPLE RECORDS (from glide list??)from another table as data.... eg: watch list field in incident table 

    - DOCUMENT ID FIELD: allows a user to select ANY RECORD FROM ANY TABLE 
  
  2) MANY TO MANY: are table where LINKS to other table is provided in RELATED LINKS section 

    ** ?? it is created using the lists 

      - sys_collections.list 
      - sys_m2m.list

  3) tables created using DATABASE VIEWS: for generating REPORTS.... sometimes many tables have to be joined.... so a READ ONLY, VIRTUAL TABLE is created using database views functionality.... 

    ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > DATABASE VIEWS 

  4) EXTENSIONS: means creating an EXTENDED TABLE.... that is.... CREATING A CHILD TABLE/CLASS from a PARENT TABLE/CLASS.... 

    - the child table INHERITS ALL FIELDS from the PARENT TABLE

    - the child table can CREATE its own UNIQUE TABLE 

    - example of PARENT TABLE/CLASS: TASK TABLE([TASK]), CONFIGURATION ITEM TABLE (CI TABLE)

    - example of CHILD TABLE/CLASS: INCIDENT TABLE, PROBLEM TABLE, CHANGE REQUEST TABLE are child class of TASK TABLE 

- TYPES of basic tableS in snow 

  1) PARENT TABLE: a table from which a numerous CHILD TABLES are extended 

  2) BASE TABLE: is a TABLE which has NO PARENT... i.e a base table is NOT A CHILD TABLE of any table.... eg: TASK TABLE 

  3) CORE TABLE: are BUILT IN TABLE that comes with SNOW PLATFORM.... eg task table, incident table, problem table.... etc 

  4) CUSTOM TABLES: tables created by ADMINS/DEVELOPERS 

    ** a custom table created in SCOPED APPLICATION has prefix x_

    ** a custom table created in GLOBAL APPLICATION has prefix u_



  ** TASK TABLE is a PARENT TABLE, BASE TABLE, CORE TABLE

  ** NOT ALL TABLES can be EXTENDED to create CHILD TABLES 

  ** reference field of CUSTOM TABLE can take records from CORE TABLES

- SCOPED APPLICATION: are application developed in a scope... such that the app is SANDBOXED and any unwanted change WON'T DESTROY the snow platform 

- GLOBAL APPLICATION: is not sandboxed.... hence any change can AFFECT the snow platform

- SCHEMA MAP: is a GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION that shows RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TABLES in snow platform.... to view it.... goto 

  ALL > SYSTEM DEFINITION > TABLES .... select  SHOW SCHEMA MAP


- TABLE TERMINOLOGIES: 

  - LIST: whenever you open a table.... you see LIST of records.... you configure LIST VIEW HERE 

    - the hamburger in list is called LIST CONTEXT MENU

  - FORM: whenever you open a RECORD from a table.... it is called a FORM.... 
  
    - We fill the record fields inside this FORM 

    - we configure FORM VIEW after opening a record

    - the hamburger in form is called FORM CONTEXT MENU
