- What is a baseline implementation?

    A baseline Implementation is a set of
    installed applications on a ServiceNow
    instance, before any configuration or
    customization has been done


- What is an instance?
    An instance is a copy of a ServiceNow
    environment that is specific to a customer.
    There are three typical environments:
    Production — where people do their work
    and support their customers
    Non-production — used for development,
    testing, and experimentation
    Development developers may get their
    own personal instance to do
    experimentation and learning outside of
    the customer/company's environment

- What is meant by Configuring an instance?
  Most of what administrators do in a
  ServiceNow instance is configuration.
  This primarily consists of things that can
  be done without code.
  Examples:
  Update list of categories on a form
  Add fields to form
  Configure list views
  Create a service catalog and
  catalog items
  Extend a table for a new hardware
  class

- What is meant by customizing an instance? 

  Customization is done when a customer
  requires additional functionality that does
  not exist in the platform, and they want to
  add features.
  Examples:
  Enhance a portal widget to
  display lists with complex access
  controls
  Add a table for special billing
  requirements

**** whenever you make CHANGES to an instance.... it must be packaged to be moved into PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT by using UPDATE SETS

**** you can also publish customizations to an APPLICATION REPOSITORY??
