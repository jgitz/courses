certain log files and binary files should not be added to git, as it will increase the size of our files in git repo..... so we should ignore these file

- to prevent a folder/files from tracking
    - goto the folder where you want to ignore certain files

        - create a new file named .gitignore

            - you can use ANY of the following TWO METHODS to create .gitignore file 

                1) use VSCODE 

                2) use POWERSHELL 

                    - run POWERSHELL (NOT CMD) as ADMINISTRATOR 

                    - to create file named .gitIgnore... use the command 

                        :: New-Item -Path <file path> -ItemType File :: 

                    - to add files/folders to ignore by git

                        - eg node_modules folder in a project 

                            :: echno /node_modules/ > .gitignore

        - open the .gitignore file and add files and folders which you want to ignore in the following format

            - for folders: <folder name>/
            - for files: <file name with extension>
            - for pattern: eg: 
                
                - *.txt: to select ALL TEXT FILES 
                - **/node_modules/: to RECURSIVELY SELECT all node_modules FOLDER in the CHILDREN FOLDERS of the PARENT REPOSITORY 

            - save the file

    ***** .gitignore won't work for a file if the file was earlied COMMITTED.... so we have to remove it exclusively from the staging area and then commit one more time.... so to make .gitignore work for a folder/file that was earlier committed..... do as follows....
        
        - remove the file/ folder from staging area
            - :: git rm --cached -r <folder/> 
                    ** / after the folder name is important

                    ** to remove a file from staging area EXCLUDE -r option

            - :: git commit -m "message" 

            **** now the file/folder is ignored if it is added inside .gitignore file
