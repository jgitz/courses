we have to review every file codes before committing.... and unstage files if necessary

- to view the changes in code on files in staging area.... we use DIFF command....

    - :: git diff --staged

        ** --- means old version

        ** +++ means new version

        ** @@ -1,3 +1,5 @@
             
             means on old version from line 1 3 line is displayed

             in new version from line one 5 lines are displayed

        ** green + lines : means added lines in new version

        ** white lines : simply displays unchanged lines

        ** --- /dev/null : means this file is a new file

    ***** the comparison is between staged file state and the state of the same file in the last commit
