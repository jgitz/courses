compare the workflow between github and local git?

- in github account... the work flow is...
 ----> make repo on github 
 ----> make file, write codes
 ----> commit changes using commit button with title and description 
 ----> make a PULL REQUEST if you are NOT the owner of the github account to make changes

- in local git.... the workflow is
  ----> goto local repo folder
  ----> initiate git inside the folder using command :: git init ::
  ----> add files and codes in repo
  ----> use status, add and commit commands
  ----> use push command to push changes to remote repo
  ----> use git pull request if you don't own the github account to which you are pushing the local repo
