if you want a stranger's full repo copied into your GITHUB ACCOUNT.... we use method called forking.

to do forking.... goto strangers repo.... click on fork button..... select your github repo....

.... now you can work on the copid repo as your wish and commit changes to it (as DEV branch)..... but if you want your changes to be added to the strangers repo, you need a PULL REQUEST.... but you can MERGE the changes from DEV branch to your MASTER branch from github.... 

**** you can't delete DEV, MASTER branch....
