 sometimes we do add and do a single commit or do many commits..... so if we want to undo ADD or COMMITS.... we use git RESET command....


1) to undo an ADD command: use command
    :: git reset ::
    or
    :: git reset <file name> ::

2) to undo last commit: use command

    :: git reset HEAD~1 :: 
    **** HEAD is in all uppercase

3)  to see LOG of all commits: use command

    :: git log ::

    **** the latest commit is on top of the screen


    **** there is a hash code for each commit.... it is the identity of corresponding commits....


4) to undo a set of commits:

    copy the hash code (from commit log)  of the commit from which the rest all commits have to be undone.... then type command

        :: git reset <hash code of the commit>

        **** only the pasted commit remains.... rest all commits after the pasted commit is DELETED from the add i.e the changes remains but it is not saved

5) to hard delete the commit codes: 

    :: git reset --hard <hash code of the commit>
