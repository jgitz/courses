- we can sign up to git hub after creating an account inside it.

*practice- after signing up to your account we can create a REMOTE repository inside it. CREATE one named GIT YOUTUBE.... give a description to it.... keep it public.... keep all other settings as it is....


- there are two ways to add a file inside github remote repository... first by creating a file in your local machine and pushing it to git hub.... second directly create a file inside your online git repository...

- what is an .md file? : it is known as a markdown file... a mark down file can be edited like a text file.... any file can be made to an md file by adding a .md at the end....

*practice- create an md file named readme.md inside your github remote repository.... :::: sign up to github.... goto repository..... click create new file.... give file name <readme.md>... write some text..... before you press commit.... there are two spaces to give TITLE and a DETAILED DESCRIPTION.... these two spaces serve to give details of your updation of file.... press commit new file.... now file is made..... goto file and add a new line to that file..... give a title and description.... press commit..... click on history/ clock button to see the history and previous version.... green highlited lines shows newly added lines.... and red for deleted lines....
