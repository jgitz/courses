- SQL (Structured Query Language): is a standardized language for handling structured relational data which are in TABULAR FORM. SQL can be used for 

    ** doing operations like CRUD, query, filter operations on data

    ** creating databases and tables 

    ** for describing table 

- RDBMS(Relational DataBase Management Systems): is a software that handles actual data management and storage. It uses SQL language internally to manipulate NORMALIZED data

    ** database systems ORGANIZE data into multiple RELATED TABLES where the 

          ** COLUMNS are called FIELDS 

          ** ROWS are called RECORDS/ENTRIES

          ** we have to DEFINE the DATATYPES of data that are expected by the COLUMNS/FIELDS

    ** eg of popular RDBMS: MySQL, postgreSQL, microsoft SQL server, oracle database

- what is NORMALIZED DATA?

      ** normalized data is date stored in SINGLE table WITHOUT NESTING. Instead related datas are stored across MULTIPLE TABLES
      
      ** MULTIPLE TABLES are then connected via LOGICAL RELATION using RECORD IDs.

**** SQL is also used by data science frameworks.... but the prominent use case is rdbms.
