..... we need to do some commands to connect to your mysql server.... the server is known as host.... host value can be 

    1) localhost: if your mysql server is your current working device

    2) ip: if your mysql server is a remote device 

- STEPS TO CONNECT to  MYSQL SERVER (WINDOWS)

      - STEP 1: open mysql shell cli from start

      - STEP 2: inside mysql shell.... type command 

          :: shell.connect({host: "localhost"}, user: "root", port:<custom port number>)

          - press enter 

              ** host can be ip address if remote device is used as a server

              ** port number can be OMITTED if you want to use DEFAULT port number 3306

        - STEP 2: write password for root user in cli 

        - STEP 3: to use sql language in the shell do this command in cli....

              :: \sql 

        - STEP 4: now you can use sql commands.... eg 

              :: SELECT "hello world";

              
                  o/p: +-------------+
                      | hello world |
                      +-------------+
                      | hello world |
                      +-------------+

                  ** don't forget ; after every sql statements

**** in this COURSE we use VSCODE EXTENSION SQLTools as client

**** you can also use WORKBENCH GUI to do database management using MYSQL
