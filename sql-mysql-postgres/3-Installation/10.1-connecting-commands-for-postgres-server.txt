- STEPS TO CONNECT TO POSTGRES SERVER

      - STEP 1: open SQL SHELL from start menu

      - STEP 2: enter server host 

          ** enter ip if remote server 

          ** leave it... if server is local machine 

      - STEP 3:  enter database name 

            ** leave it to use default database
 
      - STEP 4: enter custom port (entered during installation)

            ** leave it to use default port number 5432

      - STEP 5: enter user name  

            ** leave it to use default username (during installation)

      - STEP 6: enter password 

      - STEP 7: now you can use sql commands.... eg 

            :: SELECT 'hello world';

                o/p:

                    -------------
                    hello world
                    (1 row)

                ** single quotes '' wrapping only seem to work ??
