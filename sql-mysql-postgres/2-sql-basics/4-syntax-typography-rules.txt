- Every statement/command should end with SEMICOLON; 

- KEYWORDS should be written in UPPERCASE 

- if the FIELD NAME is same as the KEYWORD...

      ** in MYSQL: enclose the field name in BACKTICKS ``

          :: SELECT `select` FROM customers

      ** in POSTGRESQL: enclose the field name in DOUBLE QUOTES ""

          :: SELECT "select" FROM customers 


- ORDER of clauses  matter.. i.e for example.... SELECT comes first... then FROM... then comes WHERE
