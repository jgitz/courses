..... date datatypes are used to store dates in VARIOUS FORMATS 

1) to store ONLY DATE and NO TIME:

      - DATE 

            ** both mysql and postgres syntax 

                  :: <column_name> DATE;

2) to store DATE with TIME, HOUR, SECONDS, MILLISECONDS

      - DATETIME
      - TIMESTAMP

            ** both mysql and postgres syntax 

                  :: <column_name> TIMESTAMP;

                        ** if we want to hardcode the date and time while INSERTING date data..... it should be of the format 

                              <yy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss>

                                    ** time should be in 24 hour format

**** TIME ZONES: both mysql and postgres automatically converts the time data to UTC or greenwich time and stores it.... it automatically re converts to client time zones when viewing the time data
