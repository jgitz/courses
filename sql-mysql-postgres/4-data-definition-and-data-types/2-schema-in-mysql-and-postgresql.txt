      - schema in MYSQL: in mysql a schema is same as your DATABASE itself 

      - schema in POSTGRESQL: in postgresql.... schema means a way of GROUPING MULTIPLE TABLES to share certain functionalities 

          ** 2 or more tables are grouped to make a schema 

          ** TABLES can have SAME NAMES if they belong to DIFFERENT SCHEMAS

          ** TABLES inside a SCHEMA CANNOT have same name.... table names of a schema must be UNIQUE.....
