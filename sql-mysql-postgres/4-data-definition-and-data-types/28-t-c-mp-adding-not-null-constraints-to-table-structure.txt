..... some columns in the table SHOULDN'T be OMITTED to set NULL value during INSERT statements..... eg for columns are NAME, ADDRESS etc....

.... so a NOT NULL CONSTRAINT SHOULD BE added to COLUMNS while TABLE DECLARATION

- both MYSQL and POSTGRES: 

      :: CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
        <column_name> <DATA_TYPE> NOT NULL
      );

**** refer file 25 for alter statements
