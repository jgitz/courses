** in every databese COLUMN named <id> is important to give unique identifiers to each records in the table...

** id columns can be set using 2 ways 

      1) using UNIQUE constrain

            ** any number of columns can be assigned unique constraints

            ** always use INT datatype NOT NULL with UNIQUE constraint

            ** WE have to INSERT unique ids by ourselves

            ** not used now for <id> column 



      2) using PRIMARY KEY constraint 
      
            **only ONE column per TABLE can be assigned this

            ** should add INT datatype

            ** automatically assigns a unique id

            ** preferred method to assign <id> column
