- there are two types of dependencies

    1) dependencies that are needed for the application in production environment.

      eg: mongoose, express

    2) dev dependencies: dependencies that are only needed at development environment and not in production environment.

      eg: unit testing tool, bundling tool, static analysis tool, live-server etc

- command to specify dev dependencies on install

  :: npm i <package name> --save-dev

    ** now inside package.json file.... this package is stored inside the property devDependencies
