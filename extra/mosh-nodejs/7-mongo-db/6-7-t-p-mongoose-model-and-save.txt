..... mongoose model is a CLASS which is built around the defined schema to CREATE many DOCUMENTS with SCHEMA structure 

- to define a model and make document instances

    - inside the index.js 

        - define the schema using mongoose.Schema 

        - to create a MODEL follow SYNTAX 

            const <Model_variable> = mongoose.model('<Model_display_name>', <schema_variable>)

                ** Model variable name is in PASCAL CASE and SINGULAR

                ** Model DISPLAY name is in PASCAL CASE and SINGULAR 

                ** ideally model variable name and display name should be SAME SINGULAR name

                ***** m is LOWERCASE in mongoose.model command..... else error

          - to create DOCUMENTS from the model SYNTAX 

              const <docment_variable> = new <Model_variable>({
                data with fields and values 
              })

          - to SAVE the document inside the mongodb 

              const <data> = await <document_variable>.save()

                ** await used because....save() returns back a promise with saved DOCUMENT as data....

                **** if a variable is using AWAIT you should wrap it inside an ASYNC function

            - run the application using command 

                :: node index.js 


                  **** don't use nodemon because.... it'll rerun the app on every change..... hence creating multiple documents


**** mongoose model refers to COLLECTIONS in the mongo SERVER (compass or atlas)

**** if a variable is using AWAIT you should wrap it inside an ASYNC function

**** don't use nodemon because.... it'll rerun the app on every change..... hence creating multiple documents
