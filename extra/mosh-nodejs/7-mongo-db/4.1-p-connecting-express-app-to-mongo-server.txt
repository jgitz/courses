..... here we are going to make our LOCAL device as our MONGO server..... and now we need to connect our express app to the server....

- open demo-project/index.js

     - require mongoose 

     - use mongoose connect code to connect to the server 

          mongoose.connect('mongoose://<localhost>:<port number>/<database name>')
          .then(() => console.log('connected to mongoDb'))
          .catch(err => console.log('connetion unsuccessful', err))

              ** url syntax changes if you db server is remote (atlas)

              ** local host url with port number is obtained from mongoDb compass application

              ** database name is NON EXISTING database.... it'll be AUTOMATICALLY created by mongodb 


***** if the above connect url don't work.... replace it with the below url code

     mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/moshPractice")
