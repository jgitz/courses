.... we run our app in different environments like development, production etc....

.... in each environments, we tend to use different databases or mail server and different app name.....

..... so we've to set configuration detail files for the server app for each environments....

..... for this we use npm package named config....

..... steps to set configuration files 

- goto project folder

    - :: npm i config

- goto project folder

    - make a new folder named config

    
- goto projectFolder/config folder

  - to add default config files

    - make new file named default.json

    - goto default.json to define default config like this

      {
        "name": "express app"

      }

  - to add development config file

    - make new file named development.json

    - goto development.json to define config for development environment like this 

      {
        "name": "development express app",
        "mail"": {
          "host": "dev-mail-server-address"
        }

      }

        ** the name property overwrites the default name

        ** the value of host key should be set as an environment variable ??


  - to add production config file

    - make file named production.json

    - open production.json file to add production configuration settings like this

      {
        "name": "production express app",
        "mail"": {
          "host": "prod-mail-server-address"
        }

      }

- now that we've set the config files for various environments..... we can access these config file data inside the app using config.get() commands like this


  - goto index.json

      - require config library

      - to access the mailserver host address... development

        console.log(config.get("mail.host"))


** you should not store application secrets such as passwords inside the config files.... instead you should use environment variable to store password and do a different method to access it fron the app index.js safely like this


  - set pasword as an environment variable like this

    - open cli

        :: set <app>_password=<123>

    - goto projectFolder/config folder

        - make a new file named

            custom-environment-variables.json

              ** file name spelling is important

        - goto file named custom-environment-variables.json... and now we can add a password for development mail server like this

          {
            "name": "development-app",
            "mail": {
              "host": "dev-mail-server",
              "password": "app_password"
            }

          }

          ** the name and mail can be ommitted if it is set inside another environment config file

  - now to access password inside the app

    - goto index.js... and add commands

        console.log(config.get("mail.password"))
