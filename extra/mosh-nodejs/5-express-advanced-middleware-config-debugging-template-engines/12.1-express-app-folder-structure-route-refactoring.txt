- every codes relating to routes are stored in MULTIPLE JS FILES in a separate folder with name ROUTES

  - when routes are written in separate folder other than index.js 

    - **** const app = express() WON'T work as these files only have route commands

      ** so rename app in all router files as

          const router = express.Router()

      ** the paths with "/" (or /:id if required) from every method requests.... only handler is needed

      ** also default export router like this

          module.exports = router

      ** goto index.js and load the routes js files as requred

        ** now route is specified in index.js like this

          app.use("<endpoint path>", <router file loading variable>)


- move middlewares function files in separate folder named middleware
