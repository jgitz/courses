- Untill 2009 js could only be run inside browsers. Each browser uses different js engines. 

  - chrome uses v8 engine
  - edge uses chakra engine 
  - firefox uses spydermonkey engine

- in 2009, the founder of node took v8 js engine and embedded it inside C++ to create an application named node.exe

- special objects and modules are created inside the node.exe so we can interact with the server using js, like interacting with server file system.


** node is NOT a programming language or a framework.

** node is a RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT for executing js code inside server
