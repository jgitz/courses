 in redux tool kit we don't have to hard code action type in an action creator....

 .... instead the action type is automatically made by the redux from the createSlice({})....
 
 .... the action.type syntax is

    <name>/<reducer key>


..... for eg consider the cake slice

      const cakeSlice = createSlice({ 
    name: "cake", 
    initialState, 
    reducers: { 
      ordered: (state) => { 
        state.noOfCakes--
      },

      restocked: (state, action) => { 
        state.noOfCakes += action.payload
      }
    } 

  }) 

      ** the action type of cake features are
          - cake/ordered

          - cake/restocked
