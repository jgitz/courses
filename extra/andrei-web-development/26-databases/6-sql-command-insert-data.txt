- after a table is created with columns, we can insert data into the column using 

	:: INSERT INTO <table name> (<column name>, <column name>, <column name>) VALUES ("<text>", <0>, <dd-mm-yy>);

		eg INSERT INTO users (name, age, birthday) VALUES ("Teddy", 22, "25-9-1999");

- to view the inserted data inside cli


	:: SELECT * FROM <table name>;

		eg: SELECT * FROM users;

			** to selectively see column data


				:: SELECT (<column name>, <column name>) FROM <table name>;
				
					eg: SELECT (name, age) FROM users;
