- in desktop first approach, we use max-width

- in mobile first approach, we use min-width

- media query example
    - @media (max-width: 600px)  {

    }

        ** means styles gets applied on any screen sizes between 0 and 600px (including 600px)

- in case of conflicting media query screen sizes... query with less pixel gets applied


- selecting breakpoints methods

    1) select ranges of view port width for different devices


        - 300px-500px : for phones

        - 600px-900px : for tablets

        - 900-1100px : for landscape tablets

        - >1200px : for computer screens

    2) ignore device screen size and set breakpoints where the design breakpoints

- don't use pixels in media queries because pixels won't work with zoom level and browser font sizes.... we use em (not rem)

- even if we set font-size: 62.5% for html.... 1rem = 10px don't work for media queries.... and 1 rem depends on default browser font size
i.e
    1rem = 1em = 16px

- in media queries use em as the unit

- but inside the media-query code block { } width units used is rem and there 1rem = 10px

- don't add too many media quedies
