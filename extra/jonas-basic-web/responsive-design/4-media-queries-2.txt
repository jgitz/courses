            video 135 - mobile navigation buttons for menu

            - styling css using html name attribute value....

                .class_name[name = "name attribute value of the element in html"] {

                }

            - steps to make a mobile navigation and shift the navbar items into it

                - create two icons as buttons one to open mobile navigation.... other to close

                - at the vp width greater than mobile navigation.... hide these buttons using
                    display: none

                - at the vp width where the mobile screen dimension starts....make the open nav button display as...

                    display: block

                - make the position of nav bar absolute and it's parent relative..... give a background colour to see what we are doing

                - rest watch the video

                    - ** we don't always use display:none..... as it prevents animation in the element... instead we can use
                        - opacity: 0

                            ** to do the inverse 
                                - opacity: 1

                    - on elements which is set opacity: 0 ..... the elements are still accessible to key presses and clicks as well as hide it from screen reader.... to prevent that... do

                       - pointer-events: none
                       - visibility: hidden

                            ** to do the inverse

                                -pointer-events: auto

                                - visbility: visible
