conventions in js file

- always use const to make a variable and store the element we want to use via using query selector.... for eg

  const btnEl = document.querySelector(".btn-class")

    - to track a click on the above button

        btnEl.addEventListner("click", function() {
          write what we want to do
        })

    - to add a class to an element.... use .ClassList property.. eg

      - <headerEl>.classList.toggle("<new-class>")

        ** new class name don't need dot .

        ** toggle helps to add as well as remove a class (ie if there is presence of a class, it will remove.... it there is no class.... then toggle will add important)

video 141 - implement scroll

- to scroll to a section when clicked on a button

  - make the button a link

     - inside the link href put value as the id of the section we want to scroll on button click... for eg....

      href = "#<id-here>"

- to add animation to scroll in firefox and chrome.... use scroll-behavior property inside the html tag like this....

- using js forEach to html elements example

    - we want to select all anchor elements with href

        const allLinksEl = document.querySelectorAll("a:link")

          ** now all the links with href are selected but they are not a single element.... but, a list of elements

      - now to add a certain property to all links, we have to select each links... for that we use forEach

          allLinksEl.forEach(function(<link>) {
            properties here 
          })

- parameter given inside the function of addEventListner will have all the properties of that element.... for eg


      <btnEl>.addEventListner("click", function(e) {

        - console.log(e)

          ** will list all properties of the button 
          
        - const href = btn.getAttribute("href")

          console.log(href)

            ** will show href value of the button


      })

    window.scrollTo({
      top: 0
      behavior: smooth
