- actual image size of the image file should be double of the size displayed on screen.

  - because high def screens require 2px of image to display 1px design

  - in console hover over the image tag to see its size details

    - intrinsic size = actual size

    - rendered size = size displayed on screen

    - rule is select image dimensions such that

        intrinsic size width = 2 * rendered size width

    - steps:

        - use large pixel raw image in your html... say it has actual width of 1000px

        - goto console and check its rendered width.... say 188 px.... round it to 200px

        - now double 200px... so 400px...

        - take the original raw image which has width of 1000px and resize it to width of 400px...

- we need to compress images to reduce its size.... so we use the website.... sqoosh

    - don't compress and save it to jpeg.... because... jpeg cannot display transparency.... use webp..... play around.... with all the options
        - toggle off reduce palette

        - effort - max

        - quality - 91

    - ideal size is 200kB

    ***** but webp won't be displayed on all browsers

        - solution is in video 146 around 14 minutes.... by using picture and source html tags
