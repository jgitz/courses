- 3 factors for effective communication

    - how much knowledge you have
    - how much you practice with that knowledge
    - your inherent talent

- human has only one language processor and multitasking distracts our action. i.e we can only listen or read at a time. you can't do it simultaneously.

- don't start your speech with a JOKE
- START the speech with a PROMISE

    eg: after my speech you'll know some things that you never knew about communication.

- HEURISTICS SAMPLES THAT YOU NEED TO DO IN YOUR SPEECH

    1) cycle on the subject multiple times atleast 3 times

    2) build fence around your idea: i.e the idea that you are communicating should be distinguished from others idea

      eg: my algorithm is different than the other guys algorithm, because mine is faster and efficient.

    3) idea of verbal punctuation: some words to provide importance of a section of the speech, so people would listen keenly.

    4) ask questions to audience


- TIME AND PLACE FOR SPEECH

    - perfect time is 11 am, as everyone will be awake

    - place for speech is a well lit, closed, reasonably populated room, 

-  TOOLS TO USE IN YOUR PRESENTATION/SPEECH

    - use black BOARDS to explain graphics.... board enables to convey ideas in a speed that people can absorb ideas. using SLIDES is too fast... boards also allows to use your HANDS.

    - any props that relates to your speech can be used.

    - CAUTION: if you're using slides, use few words in the slides which are simple... keep images simple.... get rid of logo and title.... eliminate clutters like bullet points.

        - don't use laser pointer, instead use pointing stick or arrow graphics inside the slide.

        - use big font size (>40 ??).

        - projector board should be near to the presentor.

- speech sections

    1) promise: also add how awesome your topic is. 
    2) inspiring session: what made you inspired to do the speech about this topic.
    3) teach people how to think....

        - say speech as a story to the audience.
        - questions that audience need to ask about the story.
        - mechanism to analyse your story.
        - ways to put your stories together.
        - ways to check the relaibility of your story.

- JOB/TECHNICAL TALKS 

    - first 5 minutes to explain your VISION and steps involved in your WORKS

      - in your vision, explain the problems and how you can find solution to that.

      - when explaining the works, say the steps that are involved in your work that will give the solution.

    - conclude your talk by saying contributions. i.e about your finished works or final product.

- GETTING FAMOUS AT WORK PLACE

- FACTORS FOR A GOOD THESIS

    - you need a SYMBOL for your WORK, like signature LOGO.

    - you need a SLOGAN for your WORK.

    - surprise??

    - salient idea??

    - story about how you did, why it works, how its important.

- HOW TO STOP SPEECH/ final slide/ final words


    - CAUTION: don't put credits and project team member names on last slide, make it on the first slide.

    - CAUTION: don't put questions on last side.

    - CAUTION: no thank you or the end slide

    - CAUTION: no conclusion.

    - final slide should be titled CONTRIBUTIONS and it should explain the summary of solutions of your works in bullet points.... eg

      - argued about so and so problems

      - demonstrated so and so phenomenon

      - offered steps for so and so problem

    - concluding words can be a joke.

        - CAUTION: don't say polite thank you as final words

    - concluding words can be appreciating the audience. i.e saluting the audience.

- COMMENT FROM YOUTUBE EXPLAINING THE WHOLE SESSION


Start

1. Do not start a talk with a joke.

2. Promise - Tell them what they gonna learn at the end of your talk.

3. Cycle – make your idea repeated many times in order to be completely clear for everyone.
4. Make a “Fence” around your idea so that it can be distinguished from someone else’s idea.

5. Verbal punctuation – sum up information within your talk some times to make listeners get back on.

6.  Ask a question - intriguing one


Place and Time



7. Best time for having a lecture is 11 am.
 (not too early and not after lunch)
8. The place should be well lit.

9. The place should be seen and checked before the lecture.
10. The place should not be full less than a half, it must be chosen according to the amount of listeners.



Tools

For teaching.

1. Board – it’s got graphics, speed, target. Watch your hands! Don’t hold them behind your back, it’s better to keep them straight and use for pointing at the board.

2. Props – use them in order to make your ideas visual.

Visual perception is the most effective way to interact with listeners.



For Job Talk. Exposing, Slides

3. Don’t put too many words on a slide. Slides should just reflect what you’re saying, not the other way around. Pictures attracts attention and people start to wait for your explanation – use that tip.

4. Make slide as easy as you can – no title, no distracting pictures, frames, points and so on.

5. Do not use laser pointer – due to that you lose eye contact with the audience. Instead you can make the arrows just upon a slide. 



Informing

 

Show to your listeners your stuff is cool and interesting.

You have to be able to:

-show your vision of that problem

-show that you’ve done particular things (by steps)

All of that should be done real quick in no more than 5 min.

Persuade your listeners you’re not a rookie (Prof. Winston contrived to do that from the very first seconds of his talk)



Getting Famous

If you want to your ideas be remembered you’ve got to have
 "5 S"


- Symbols associate with your ideas (visual perception is the best way to attract attention)

- Slogan (describing your idea)

- Surprise (common fallacy that is no longer true, for instance, just after you’ve told about it)

- Salient Idea (not necessarily important but the one that sticks out)

- Story (how you did it, how it works…)



How to End



- Don’t put collaborators at the end, do that at the beginning.
- Question’s the worst way to end a talk.

- It’s good to end with a Contribution slide – to sum up everything you’ve told with your OWN decision.

- At the very end you could tell a joke since people then will leave the event feeling fun and thus keep a good memory of your talk.
- "Thank you (for listening)" isn’t good ending, it’s trite at least. You can end with a quote of a prominent person (my own knowledge), with a salute to people (how much you valued the time being here, the people over here..., “I’d like to get back, it was fun!”


That part actually I find the hardest one, since saying “Thanks” is a kind of a habit and it’s really difficult to make people clap if your talk wasn’t fascinating, so you’d better do this great and you won’t have to worry about how to end!
