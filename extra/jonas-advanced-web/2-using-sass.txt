- make a folder for sass

- sass files that we make should have .scss extension as we use scss syntax..the main file where we write sass code is main.scss file.... so

    - goto sass folder

        - create file named main.scss

- now we write all our css codes in sass folder inside main.scss file..

- now inside project folder

    - make folder named css.... to store the compiled sass code as css file

    - goto css folder

        - create a file named style.css

            ** style.css is the file where compiled sass code is outputted as css codes

- write sass codes in main.scss

- to compile codes to style.css.... use command

    :: npm run compile:sass


        ** now css code comes up inside css/style.css file
