align items : baseline - means align items to the base of the text font

order - default order is of flex item is 0..... more -ve integer orders items to the start.... more +ve integers orders the items to the end

flex-grow: 1 - item occupies maximum width with respect to width of other items....

  flex-grow: 2 - means items become double the size of other elements

flex-basis: <% or px> : can be used to set width instead of using width property.... here width is set in % or px with respect to width of the container

  ** but even when we decrease vp width.... the item shrinks

  ** default value: auto


flex-shrink: 0 - means upon decreasing vp width.... the item won't decrease its size.... instead scroll bar appears........ flex-shrink: 1 means the item gets smaller when decrease in vp width

    
shorthand

  - flex: <flex grow> <flex shrink> <flex-basis>

    eg: flex: 0 1 300px


flex-wrap: wrap : when there are too much items inside the container.... the items get into a new line.... and prevents container overflow

align-content: center/flex-end... - in a big container with wrapped items.... this option positions the whole content along cross-axis

  align-content: space-between - makes space between the rows
