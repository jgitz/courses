- this is an object that is made inside global execution context creation as well as in function execution context. (refer note 0)

- using this keyword in a function refers to the object the function belongs to.

- this enables to reuse a function with different objects

- BUT this object is determined entirely on how a function is CALLED/INVOKED..

  ** there are 4 ways in which a function is called

    1) implicit binding: function is defined inside an object.

    2) explicit binding: function and object is defined separately.

    3) new binding: a single function can be reused to make different copies of instance of same function with the new key word.

        ** the function defined after new keyword is known as constructor function and the practice is to have constructor function name to start with UPPER CASE.

    4) default binding: 

    **** ORDER OF PRECENDENCE OF BINDING:

          ** trick: NE ID 

              - New binding

              - Explicit binding 

              - Implicit binding 

              - Default binding
