....to use a typescript file.... these steps have to be followed 

step1: create a .ts file with any name 

step2: inside the .ts file 

        - add first line as 

            export {} 

              ** means this file export nothing.... this line makes the .ts file a module file... instead of script file 

        - add the codes for your program 

step3: .... now the typescript file should be compiled to a .js file.... to do that.... inside the terminal... run the command....

        :: tsc <file.ts>

          ** now a new file named file.js will be created 

step4:.... the new .js file is the one that we ACTUALLY RUN using NODE..... to run the program and get output....inside the terminal.... type the command ....

    :: node <file.js>

        ** now the desired output is obtained inside the terminal 

step5:.... now if we want to update the code in .ts file.... and to AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE the .JS file code....BEFORE the MODIFICATION of code.... inside the terminal... type the command 

    :: tsc <file.js> --watch


**** even if we write the codes in .ts file.... the file we are running is .js file


** check the practice folde to see the HELLO WORLD .ts program
