- typescript encourages to use LET and CONST keywords to declare variables.... 

    **let and const DOESN'T allow to REDECLARE the same variable with different value within the SAME SCOPE by using let and const key word i.e... 

        let x = 30 
        let x = 20 // error

          ** the above won't be allowed

- LET should be used to variables whose values can get changed in the future 

    ** variable with let keyword can be declared without assigning a value 

- CONST should be used to variables whose values won't change 

    ** variable with a const keyword CANNOT be declared without an assigned value.... else error
