- js engine is composed of mainly interpreter, compiler, call stack and memory heap

- memory heap: memory which is used to write and store data

- call stack: keep track of code and execute the code in order. it follows LIFO

    ** each execution context in call stack is called stack frame 

** simple primitive datatypes are stored in call stacks

** non primitive datatypes are stored inside memory heap
