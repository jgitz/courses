- synchronous code: runs the code line by line 

- asynchronous code: DOESN'T allow the code to run in sequence.... asynchronous code allows the asynchronous operations to run in BACLGROUND.... while the other codes are allowed to run continously 

- ASYNCHRONOUS CODES IN JS EG

    - setTimeout()
    - setIntervel()
    - load event listener

        ** callback function of load event only triggers when everything inside the webpage is loaded 


    - <image_query>.src method 

    ** AJAX (Asynchronous js and xml) CALLS to backend via http requests GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE

**** not all methods with CALLBACK functions are asynchronous in nature 

**** not all event listeners are async..... eg click event is NOT async in nature
