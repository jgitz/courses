.... we can manipulate attributes of elements such as alt, src, etc 

    ** class attribute is known as className
    in dom


- to access an INBUILT ATTRIBUTE of an element 

      eg : <query_select_variable>.alt
      eg : <query_select_variable>.src

- to access a CUSTOM ATTRIBUTE given to an element (sometimes in frameworks, we add custom attributes)

    <query_select_variable>
    .getAttribute("<attribute name>")

- to set VALUES to INBUILT ATTRIBUTE 

    eg :  <query_select_variable>
          .alt = "another alt"

- to set VALUES to CUSTOM attributes

      <query_select_variable>
      .setAttribute("<attribute name>", "<attribute value>")


** if the ATTRIBUTE is SRC.... use the ABSOLUTE PATH (i.e FULL URL)

**** SRC AND HREF

    ** <query_select_variable>.src : gives ABSOLUTE URL

    ** <query_select_variable>.getAttribute("src") : gives the RELATIVE PATH URL

**** DON'T USE className attribute to set class as it OVERWRITES EVERY class names
