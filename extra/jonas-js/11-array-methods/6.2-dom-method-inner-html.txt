- inner HTML method : it is used to view and set element content and data inside a parent element

    <querySelect_parent_element_Variable>
    .innerHTML

     ** console logging the above displays every child elements contained inside the parent element

** USE CASE: to EMPTY the all the child element content of parent element by assigning an empty string to it like this  

    <querySelect_parent_element_Variable>
    .innerHTML = ''


** what difference between dom methods innerHTML and textContent?

    ** textContent dom method only manipulates the text content which is wrapped by the element and not any other html elements inside

      * innerHTML dom method manipulates the entire child element tags and their contents which are inside a parent element
