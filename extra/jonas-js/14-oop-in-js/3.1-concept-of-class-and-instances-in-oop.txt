** js DON'T have concept of CLASS 

- CLASS: in traditional oop CLASS is a BLUEPRINT from which OBJECTS can be gererated based on the RULES specified inside the class 

    ** class is NOT an OBJECT 

- INSTANCES : many variants of OBJECT with data and methods CREATED FROM the CLASS is known as INSTANCES

**** ANALOGY: class is BLUEPRINT....and instances are many HOUSES built with SAME BLUEPRINT
