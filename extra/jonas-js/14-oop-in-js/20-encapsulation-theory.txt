- ENCAPSULATION of PROPERTIES AND METHODS:

      ** means prevent manipulation of properties and values from outside of the objects accidentaly by the developers

- ENCAPSULATION can be achieved in JS using TWO WAYS 

    1) using PROTECTED PROPERTIES and METHODS via underscore _ NAMING CONVENTION. 

    2) using PRIVATE properties and syntax USING # naming convention.
