function: is a block of code that takes input data, transforms the data and then outputs some data....

- parameters: placeholder local variables of a function to hold input arguments 

- arguments: are data fed into the function during function invocation

- return value: output data from a function and return value ends the function execution.

  ** function without return value returns undefined 

  ** console.log() is a function 

>>>>>>> TYPES OF FUNCTION >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1) function declaration : functions defined with function keyword

  ** if assigned to a variable, no need bracket for the variable as variable already stores value of the function

2) function expression: assign an identifier to the function 

    ** need to use bracket to the variable name to invoke the function

    ** type of expression variable is FUNCTION 

** function declaration vs function expression: 

    - function declaration can be hoisted but not function expression 

3) arrow function: faster way to write a function expression.


** standard is to use function expression over function declarations... because it's not a good practice to have hoisting as well your function gets stored in a variable in a single line 

** arrow function and function expression has different use cases as they have some differences
