- objects are fundemental concept of js

- there are many ways to declare an object in js (later).... easiest way is to use OBJECT LITERALS.... i.e simply enclose key value pairs inside a {} and assign it to a variable 

** in console the object keys are listed in alphabetical order 

- object vs array : 

    ** array for ordered data 

    ** object for unstructured data
