- strict mode is to make your js code secure


- strict mode in js is activated by using the following line as the first line of your js file 

  "use strict";

    ** this can be used inside a function or a block. But it's not recommended, instead give strict mode to entire file 

- advantages of strict mode

    - consoles error if the variable name is wrong

    - won't allow reserved key words to be set as variable names. eg: interface, name, new, private, if etc variable names won't be allowed

    - set this object to undefined (if not strict mode, it will be set to WINDOW object in BROWSER and GLOBAL object in NODEJS)

    - in strict mode...along with variables,  functions are also block scoped.... i.e functions declared inside a block can only be accessed inside that scope..... if not in strict mode, the fuction are scoped to the nearest parent function.....

    

**** not working in nodejs
