- scope: in js refers to the space or environment in which a certain variable is declared.

- there are 3 scopes in js 

    1) block scope : created by {} of statements such as if, for etc

      **** {} of an object is NOT a BLOCK SCOPE

    2) function/local scope : created by {} of functions

    3) global scope


***** in strict mode...along with variables,  functions are also block scoped.... i.e functions declared inside a block can only be accessed inside that scope..... if not in strict mode, the fuction are scoped to the nearest parent function.....

** var is function scoped i.e it look for variables in the nearest function scope

** let and const are block scoped
