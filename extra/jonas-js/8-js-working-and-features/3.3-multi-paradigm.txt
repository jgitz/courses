- js is a language that supports multiple paradigms

- PARADIGM: an approach of strutcturing a code with multiple style.

    - there are 3 paradigms

        1) PROCEDURAL Programming : organising code in linear way with some functions in between

        2) FUNCTIONAL Programming :

        3) OBJECT ORIENTED Programming

        ** js supports all the above 3 


    - another classification of paradigms are

      1) IMPERATIVE : we need to describe every instruction to attain an output..... eg for loop in js 

      2) DECLARATIVE : we only need to specify what output we want..... steps which produce the output is abstracted..... eg: array map, reduce methods
