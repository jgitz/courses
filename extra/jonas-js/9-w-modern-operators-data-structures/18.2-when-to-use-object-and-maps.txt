- MAPS and OBJECTS are preferred when you want to give a KEY to describe the VALUES


- OBJECT FEATURES

    - use to structure data using simple key value pairs

    - easy to access values using . and [] notation

    - cannot be directly used in LOOP (iterated)


- MAP FEATURES

    - keys can be any datatypes

    - properties can be looped (iterated)

    - better performance than object 

    - easy to compute size using size method

- WHEN to use OBJECTS?

    - if the incoming data is in JSON format


    - if you want FUNCTION as values (METHODS)

- WHEN to use MAPS?

    - when you need KEYS that are NOT STRINGS
