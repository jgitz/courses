     ..... we can do ANY ARITHEMATIC operations between 2 date variables..... BUT

        ** the result of the ARITHEMATIC OPERATION between 2 string will be of a NUMBER DATATYPE which is IN MILLISECOND FORMAT

        ** we need to CONVERT this millisecond result to DAYS by 

          DIVIDING MILLISECOND BY (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)

        ** when doing date subtraction in an ORIGINAL APP always WRAP the output inside Math.abs() to take MODULUS of NEGATIVE NUMBERS 

      ** for more complicated date operations like daytime saving etc.... we use MOMENT JS LIBRARY

    

     */

     // calculating number of days between 2 dates..... from january 1 to january 11

      // step 1: initializing dates january 1 and january 11

        const january_1 = new Date(2023, 0, 1) // type is OBJECT
        const january_11 = new Date(2023, 0, 11) // type is OBJECT

      // step 2:  doing ARITHEMATIC SUBTRACTION to calculate the difference between the dates

        const difference = january_11 - january_1

        console.log(difference) //  864000000 ** millisecond ** type is number
      
      // step 3: converting the difference result from MILLISECOND TO DAYS

        const number_of_days = difference / (1000  *60 * 60 * 24) 

        console.log(number_of_days) // 10 ** i.e the difference between january 1 and january 11 is 10 days
