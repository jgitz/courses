... badge component is where we add tags...

.... in the design we have badges of 2 colors 

  - primary color 

  - secondary color 

.... also we have badge of small size 


** use of BEM to design badge variations 

    - BLOCK of the badge is created with css styles for basic structure with class name badge 

      ** SPAN ELEMENT is used to MAKE STRUCTURE of a badge

    - modifiers: 

        - modifier class "badge--primary" and badge--secondary" is used to create color variations of badge 

        - modifier class "badge--small" is used to make smaller version of the badge .... use FONT SIZE to make size vairations 

** white-space:nowrap: badge elements MUST NOT WRAP its content to NEXT LINE.... badge contents SHOULD BE IN A SINGLE LINE 

** to adjust size of the badges....  VARY FONT SIZE instead of paddings
