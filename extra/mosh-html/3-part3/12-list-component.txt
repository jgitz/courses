.... in the design we can see 2 types of list 

  1) an INLINE LIST to specify rate of domain names 

  2) a normal VERTICAL LIST with TICK MARK as bullet points 

** we implement list variations using BEM standards 

  ** DON'T use li element as selector... instead use custom made classes 

  ** .list is the class to define BLOCK of BEM 

  ** .list--tick and .list--inline are MODIFIERS to make inline and tick variations of the list 

  ** .list__item is the class to define ELEMENT in BEM.... i.e .list__item is CHILD of the BLOCK class list.... it has NO STAND ALONE IDENTITY 

** list-style-image: url("<image path>") : is used to replace the bullets with ANY IMAGE..... here we use SVG of TICK image 

** in project folder.... always make an IMAGE FOLDER to save the IMAGE/ICONS USED 


- list varition styles are implemented with media queries
