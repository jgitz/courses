... we need to design link component

** we design the link component inside COMPONENTS FOLDER.... and after designinig... paste the css to STYLES.CSS 

- link component design

  - link component is designed with media queries


** STANDARD


  ** DON'T use anchor element selector to style the css .... instead USE A CUSTOM CLASS.... here we used the class "link-arrow"

  ** ALWAYS use PSEUDO ELEMENT ::after to add an ICON to the link 


  ** when using selector combination with CLASS, PSEUDO CLASS and PSEUDO ELEMENT... use the following syntax order 

    eg: .class:hover::after 

    **** if this order changes.... WON'T WORK

  ** always use SEPARATE MEDIA QUERIES for each component 

  ** margin between component and its icon should be given in PIXEL UNIT as we need it to be constant
