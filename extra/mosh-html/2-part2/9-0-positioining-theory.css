ELEMENT POSITIONING USING CSS....

- POSITION CSS PROPERTY.... values are as follows 

    1) static (default)

        ** can't add css values for top, bottom, left or right 

    2) relative (relative to its original position)

        ** now the element can be specified top, bottom, left or right

        ** DOESN'T affect the positioning of other elements in the container

    3) absolute (relative to the subject element's parent element)

        ** to implement this... first the PARENT ELEMENT should be given 

            position: relative 

        ** now then set the position: absolute; to the subject element 

        ** now we can add top, bottom, left and right value to the subject element..... and the element is positioned relative to the parent element 

        ** AFFECTS the position of other elements of the parent element 

    4) fixed (relative to the view port )

        ** used for nav bar

** z-index is used to set the position of the element in z-axis.... more positive number value means more close to the screen
