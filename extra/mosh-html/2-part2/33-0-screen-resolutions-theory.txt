- physical resolution: dimension of the lcd screen hardware in pixels.... eg 480 x 320 means 480px width and 320px height

- logical resolution: actual resolution of the screen output after scaling of the output to x number of times 

    eg: older apple mobiles have hardware resolution of 480 x 320 px..... while new apple phone 4 have hardware resolution of 960 x 640px (double of old apple).... 

    ..... so we might think an image of width 320 px will look smaller on new iphone 4.... but, WRONG.... they will look the same as new iphone 4 has 2X scale factor.... i.e to display 1px the new iphone will take 2px....

** so new iphone has 

    - physical resolution: 960px x 640px
    - logical resolution: 480px x 320px

** the width and height we give inside CSS points to LOGICAL RESOLUTION and NOT physical resolution

- DPR Ratio (Device Pixel Ratio): ratio between PHYSICAL RESOLUTION to LOGICAL RESOLUTION

    ** new iphone 4 has DPR = 2

- High Density Screens: screen hardwares with DPR GREATER THAN 1


***** RELEVANCE of DPR ratio: images in your website has to be accessed by devices of various DPR ratios.... and using only single image of a specific resolution that look good in 1x screen will be BLURRY on 2x and 3x screeens..... the solution for this images

    ** make 3 versions of 1x image... such that it suits resolution of 2x and 3x screens... follow the below steps with eg....

        - step1: find the highest resolution of the image you want to display..... SAY 2000px x 2000 px 

        - step2: SAY you only want 400 px image in 1x screen.... so you need 800px image in 2x screen and 1200px image in 3x screens 

        - step3: open 2000px image in photoshop and make 3 versions of the image in

            - 1200px

            - 800px 

            - 400px 

            ** set baseline compression of 7 in photoshop

            **** follow conversion of image from higher resolution to lower.... and NOT VICE VERA 

        - step4: use SRCSET attribute inside IMG tag to set display of 1x, 2x and 3x versions of the image.... (next lesson)


    ***** you need not make multiple versions of all the images
