... for easy styling with readymade style classe we can use css frameworks like

  - bootstrap (popular)
  - semantic ui
  - foundation
  - milligram (used in our course)

** some common bootstrap classes 

    - form-label: class applied to label tag 

    - form-control: class applied to input tags 

    - form-group: added to div wrapper that wraps a label-input tag pair 

    - mb-3: margin bottom of 3 units

    - btn: class applied to button tag 

    - btn-success: add green color to buttons

    - w-50: makes a container to occupy 50% of vw

***** we use milligram framework on our course as it is lightweight
