..... images can also be converted to url and stored in the browser memory.... so that there is no need for browser to send another http request to download the image....

- steps to convert image to url 

    - step 1: google data url generator.... click any site 

    - step 2: upload the image you want to convert to url .... click generate

    - step 3: copy the generated url code 

    - step 5: inside the project html.... paste the copied code to SRC attribute of IMAGE TAG 


***** this method IS NOT USED NOW.... because 

        - generated url has MORE SIZE than the original file 

        - slow on MOBILE DEVICES

        - not easy to replace the image as you have to generate another data url for the new image
