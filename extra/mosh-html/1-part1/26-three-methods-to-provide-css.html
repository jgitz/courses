  ..... there are 3 methods to provide css styles to an html page 

    1)  EXTERNAL STYLESHEETS: css is written in separate .css file and is linked to html using LINK tag inside HEAD TAG .... like this 

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="<css file path>"/>

          ** link tag links something to an html file 

          ** rel attribute defines WHAT TYPE of file is LINKED via LINK TAG

          ** most preferred method to write css as this is SCALABLE
  
    2) EMBEDDED STYLE SHEETS: plain css codes are written inside <style></style> tag which is ADDED as the LAST CHILD inside the HEAD TAG of an html file 

          ** not preferred... because DIFFICULT to SCALE

          ** commonly USED to overwrite css from external stylesheet

    3) INLINE STYLES: css styles are written inside style ATTRIBUTE in each ELEMENTS of the page 

          ** least preferred method 


** priority by html : inline styles > embedded stylesheet > external stylesheet

** EXTERNAL STYLE SHEETS are used to satisy the principle of 'SEPARATION OF CONCERNS'
