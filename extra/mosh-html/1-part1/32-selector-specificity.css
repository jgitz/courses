/* 

..... sometimes we apply 2 style css to a single element with 2 different values.... 

.... in this case the CSS APPLIES the style BASED ON SPECIFICITY 

- SELECTOR SPECIFICITY: is a value that defines PRIORITY of SELECTORs in CSS for applying styles 

  ** selector priority goes like: ID SELECTOR > CLASS/ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR > ELEMENT SELECTOR

  ** in vscode selector specificity can be seen by hovering mouse over the selector inside the css file 

    ** the specificity value is displayed in the form (<number of id selectors>, <number of class/attribute selector>, <number of element selector>)

      - eg: 

          - (1,0,0) : means 100 and the selector has.... 1 id selector..... 0 class/attribute selector.... 0 element selector

          - (0, 1, 0): means 10 and the selector has..... 0 id selector.... 0 class/attribute selector.... 0 element selector

** !important: is a VALUE APPLITED to a CSS PROPERTY if we want it to be given the TOP MOST PRIORITY... EG

    p { color: green !important; }

      ** now the color of the paragraph will be green even if we add another color to it in subsequent css properties 

** always the last css selector style will be applied to the element
