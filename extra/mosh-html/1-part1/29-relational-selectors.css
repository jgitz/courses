/* 

- relational css selectors: are used to select elements based on reference of other elements 

***** relational selectors has the following problems 

    - not fast as basic selectors 

    - fragile because moving position of elements affects the css 

** only use relational selectors if the html code is no going to change..... else use basic id and class selectors
