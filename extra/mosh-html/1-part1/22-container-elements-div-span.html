  - container element: is that class of elements which are used to wrap conntectd html codes into sections..... commonly used container elements are .... DIV and SPAN elements 

  - div tag: is a container element to wrap multiple elements 

    ** is a BLOCK ELEMENT: i.e 

          - every div element starts in a NEW LINE 

          - every div element takes FULL WIDTH of the viewport

              ** can be CHANGED by adding CSS WIDTH to the div
          - default heigh of an EMPTY block element is 0..... if the block element is filled with content.... it takes the height of the content

  - span tag: used to wrap text content.... most common use case is to highlight the wrapped text using css style 

      ** span is an INLINE ELEMENT.. i.e

            - it DOESN'T take full width of viewport 

            - a span wrapped text DOESN'T start on a new line...
