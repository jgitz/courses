- What is mongodb?

    - mongodb is a open source... NON RELATIONAL/NoSQL database.... which is used to store data in BSON FORMAT (JSON with types) inside documents

- What is BSON format?

    - BSON (Binary JS object notation) is a json like format in which we can add datatypes like date, string, boolean etc to the property values

    - each property and value pair is known as FIELD-VALUE PAIR 

- How is data stored in MONGODB?

    - A database in mongoDb consists of many COLLECTIONS (~tables in sql)

    - a SINGLE collection has MANY DOCUMENTS (~rows in a table)

    - data is written inside a document in BSON format

        ** each document will have a _id property added automatically by the mongodb 

        ** _id of a document acts as the PRIMARY KEY of the document


    
- FEATURES OF MONGODB 

    - non relational database
    
    - DOCUMENT BASED: i.e stores data in document as field-value pairs in BSON format

    - scalable: i.e as your database requirement grows, it is easy to scale up mongodb  

    - flexible: no schema is needed to define a document.... so each document in a collection can have different number and type of fields 

- ADVANTAGES of mongodb OVER SQL databases 

    - in MONGO.... a single field can hold multiple values using ARRAYS 

        * in sql.... a single field(column) CANNOT hold multiple values 

    - in mongo db.... we can EMBED documents (EMBEDDING/DE-NORMALIZING) inside another document

        * in sql.... we CANNOT put a table inside field of another table.... instead we make a new table and link them to the field
