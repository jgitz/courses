  .... node lists and html collections are two different structures in which different collections of objects are outputted in dom.... different dom method gives either html colleciton or node list

  - NODE LIST: a node list gives outputs ALL the NODES which are CHILDREN of a parent node

      - it includes every node such as text node, comment node and element node contained in the parent

      - foreEach ARRAY METHOD works on a variable stored with node list

      - a variable stored with NODE LIST is NOT LIVE.... i.e.... the node list ITEM in js DOESN'T UPDATE with change in DOM 

        ** exception is <>.childNodes method 

  - HTML COLLECITON: an html collection only gives out CHILD NODES which are ELEMENT NODES from a parent 

    - No comment node or text node is included in html collection 

    - FOR EACH method DON'T work on an HTML COLLECTION 

    - simple FOR LOOP is used to loop all items of an HTML COLLECTION 

    - a variable stored with HTML COLLECTION is LIVE..... i.e the items in the HTML COLLECTION changes with DOM UPDATES

- METHODS/PROPERTIES THAT RETURN HTML COLLECITON:

    - <>.getElementByTagname('')

    - <>.getElementsByClassName('')

    - <>.getElementsByTagNameNS('') : returns tags with custom name space given inside the ()

    - <>.children

    

- METHODS/PROPERTIES THAT RETURN NODE LIST:

    - <>.querySelectorAll()
    - <>.childNodes

- PROPERTIES THAT RETURN NODE: 

    - <>.firstChild
    - <>.lastChild
    - <>.nextSibling
    - <>.previousSibling

- PROPERTIES THAT RETURN ELEMENT NODES: 

    - <>.firstElementChild
    - <>.lastElementChild
    - <>.nextElementSibling
    - <>.lastElementSibling
